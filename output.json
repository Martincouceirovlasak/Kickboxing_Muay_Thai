                    "content": "The world today is buzzing around the term ‘ Generative AI ’. Top tech and management firms including McKinsey, KPMG, Gartner, and Bloomberg are constantly researching to gauge the power of this new technology and predict its future. All these studies show that the rising impact of generative AI in the enterprise has made it an essential skill in today’s workplace. The surveys also show that GenAI is set to become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032, and everyone would want to be a part of it. This article discusses the applications, growth, and impact of generative AI across various industries and how you can be a part of the global change. Generative AI is no longer just a buzzword. This new technology where AI can create new content and learn through practice, has taken the world by storm. GenAI tools are basically large learning models (LLMs) capable of generating content based on the data they are trained on. They learn patterns and structures from the training data and produce outputs that follow similar patterns. These models can create images, video, music, speech, text, software code, product designs, and more. The possibilities of this technology are endless owing to the vast amount of training data currently available. The last few months have seen a steady expansion of the field, with new applications and use cases of generative AI being discovered every day. At an enterprise level, GenAI integration has led to faster outputs, better productivity, and economic growth. As a result, more and more companies are now using generative AI to save time and money. Enterprise applications of generative AI include automation, augmentation of humans or machines, and autonomous execution of business and IT processes. McKinsey reports that enterprises worldwide are maximizing productivity gains and minimizing risks by deploying generative AI tools. Companies are now investing more in generative AI training and coaching, use case selection, workforce upskilling, and risk controls. Going forward, organizations will require their workforce to be adept in generative AI to stay relevant in their jobs. The GenAI market currently includes model training infrastructure, inference devices for LLMs, digital ads, specialized software and services, personalized assistants, and copilots that accelerate coding. While the companies that develop generative AI tools and software are the biggest beneficiaries in the domain, the applications of these products are helping industries across sectors to reap benefits. So how big is generative AI today? In 2022, the GenAI market was evaluated at $40 billion, which has evidently grown with time. A report by Bloomberg Intelligence predicts that generative AI will become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032, owing to a compound annual growth rate of 42% in the coming decade. Generative AI has been on Gartner ‘s Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence since 2020. However, 2023 has been its breakout year in enterprise. Although the technology is relatively new, it has flourished to become an integral part of almost every industry. As per a global report by McKinsey , 33% of leading companies are already using generative AI, while another 25% of them are in the process of AI integration. The report also states that 22% of C-suite executives use AI tools for work. As new uses and applications of the technology are being discovered, its usability is further expanding. Job roles across all levels in all sectors are being automated, minimizing human intervention, and saving human work hours for more important tasks. Enterprises are therefore on the lookout for AI-skilled talent, giving them an edge. Furthermore, 40% of the companies surveyed by McKinsey are planning on increasing their investment in AI, as the technology advances. This shows that slowly, but surely, all jobs will involve some level of AI-powered functioning, and we all need to stay prepared for it. Business leaders from around the world are intrigued by the possibilities of generative AI and are convinced that it is truly a game-changer. Dr. Vikas Agrawal, the Senior Principal Data Scientist at Oracle Analytics Cloud affirms that generative AI holds the potential to revolutionize enterprise solutions, especially in areas related to text and user interfaces. Speaking of upskilling the workforce, he said, “As AI tools evolve, data scientists need skills to enhance and improve these tools, not just operate them.” On a similar note, Jepson Taylor, the ex-chief AI Strategist at Dataiku stated that the triumph of an AI startup depends on recruiting the right talent. As the co-lead of the AI Masterclass at NYU, he foresees a future where AI systems will be able to write and enhance their code autonomously, ushering in more efficient and powerful applications. In an interview with Analytics Vidhya , Sandeep Singh, Head of Applied AI at Beans.ai, drew a comparison between the AI ecosystem in India and the US. “India’s AI ecosystem is uniquely positioned for rapid adoption and productization, unlike the Bay Area’s research-focused AI landscape.”, he said. Coming to industry leaders in India, Mr. Srikanth Valamakanni is the Group CEO, Co-founder, and Vice-Chairman of Fractal Analytics, one of the largest AI companies in India. He believes that most functions in an organization will get automated in the years to come, and only those who stay updated and have the edge can continue being assets to their companies. Mr. Anand S., the CEO and Chief Data Scientist at Gramener sees generative AI as the next big thing since the launch of Google. He has already outsourced most of his coding work to AI and has trained a bunch of LLMs to do various tasks for him, thereby optimizing his work, and saving time. Within a short span of time, generative AI has impacted almost all industries, making it a quintessential part of enterprises today. According to McKinsey , a majority of employees across regions, industries, and seniority levels are already using generative AI tools for work. While technology, media, and telecom companies use generative AI the most, business, legal, and financial services are not far behind. Even healthcare, energy, and retail sectors have started harnessing the benefits of generative AI. KPMG recently published a report stating the expectations of generative AI applications in the years to come, divided by sector and function. Here are some of the future predictions. Enterprises are constantly looking for ways to optimize processes and expand their business. The best way for enterprises to scale their operations is by increasing the productivity of their existing workforce. In today’s world, adapting generative AI tools is the most innovative and optimal way to do this. Nearly 75% of the enterprises surveyed by KPMG agree with this, stating that generative AI will increase productivity. All these firms have either already embraced GenAI or are planning to do so within the next two years. While 68% of the survey participants think it will change the way people work, 63% of them believe that it will encourage innovation. In the long run, mundane tasks will get automated, saving human intelligence for more strategic activities. GenAI tools aim at assisting employees to be more creative and skillful, and not replace them or take their jobs. However, 46% of the survey respondents believe job security will be at risk and generative AI tools can replace some jobs. The survey states that the jobs at highest risk are in administrative roles (65%), customer service (59%), and the creative fields such as marketing and design (34%). Tech giants like Nvidia, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI were the first ones to harness the technology. Lately, however, open-source models and cloud platforms have let smaller companies and start-ups get on the GenAI bandwagon. 71% of the enterprises surveyed by KPMG plan to implement their first generative AI solution within the next two years. So, it is still not too late for you or your organization to embrace the technology and make the best of it. Here’s what companies can do now to be a part of the latest technological revolution: As per KPMG’s report , a majority of enterprises are yet to take their step toward generative AI. 71% of them plan on implementing their first GenAI solution in 6 months to 2 years. This makes now, the best time for your company to move in. Adopting new technologies sooner rather than later promises many first-mover advantages. Firstly, you’ll get a head start on things. With the pace at which GenAI is expanding, the gap between first-movers and fast-followers is soon bound to widen significantly. At this point, it is still possible to catch up and keep track of new tools and applications. Early adoption also gives you an upper hand when it comes to investing in the best talent, tools, and software. Further, it lets you figure out solutions for any risks or hindrances that may come in the way before your competitors do. While this change may seem overwhelming, Analytics Vidhya is here to help you. We offer services in generative AI training, upskilling of employees, hiring AI-skilled talent, and developing a data-driven workforce. Successful technological transformation of enterprises involves constantly responding and adapting to inevitable changes. While generative AI is capable of doing this, employees using GenAI tools must know how and when to apply them. Developing the best GenAI strategy involves a lot of trial and error. Enterprise leaders need to be ready to quickly assess, adapt, or pivot strategies to account for the enormous potential of generative AI. These leaders must therefore possess contextual knowledge of the business components as well as the technological aspects of GenAI. Analytics Vidhya offers comprehensive GenAI courses for employees of all levels, empowering them to make the right decisions to optimize and upscale their business. Generative AI is transforming everything – the way we think, create, work, interact, and live. Enterprises may be skeptical about reckoning with such a disruptive technological force. Enterprise leaders often find it challenging to figure out how to deploy generative AI to harness the best by minimizing the potential risks. The only solution to facing this fear and boldly embracing the new technology is by empowering the leaders and the workforce at large, with clear and concise knowledge of generative AI. This will further prepare them to accept the changes in industry dynamics, business models, operating models, and the workplace. The successful integration of GenAI into any enterprise requires the workforce to develop literacy around this new technology. The company must be willing to invest in training its employees to ensure more productivity and minimize risks. Now, learning new skills or upskilling may not be easy for everyone. It is hence important for the company to find the right courses, learning platforms, and instructors for employees of all levels. Analytics Vidhya can help you there by providing a comprehensive learning experience for all. We are equipped to train employees of every skill level , from C-suite leaders and VPs to managers, assistants, and even interns. While preparing to embrace new technology, it is important that enterprises have a clear idea as to what they wish to achieve through this change. Having a clear goal will help chart out the exact business needs and select the right genAI tools for the company. Generative AI comes with endless potential and it is easy to get entangled in it, all at once. While GenAI can do almost everything, it may only be required in certain functions, in particular departments of the organization. It is therefore important to stay focused and be on track with what to adopt and what is the best way to get the desired results. Enterprises may need to experiment with a few different tools, solutions, and strategies, before figuring out the best or most optimal approach. Defining the use cases is the first step towards any such experimentation. Using generative AI tools in enterprises comes with the risk of sharing confidential company information. Most organizations are concerned about cybersecurity and data privacy as they do not have a rigid structure or policies in place for governing, training, and implementing generative AI solutions responsibly. While defining use cases and figuring out potential opportunities, it is also important to ensure the responsible use of generative AI. Enterprises need strong guardrails in place to limit any such risks – be it financial, reputational, or ethical. There must be a hierarchy of who is responsible and accountable for ensuring the responsible use of AI. The people involved in this must uphold ethical considerations and stay updated on new laws and regulations regarding the use of AI. Embracing new technology into an enterprise would mean a change in job roles and the acquisition of new and skilled talent. The adoption of generative AI into the workforce is bound to change the work environment and existing practices. During this transition, it is important to ensure the existing employees embrace this change without fear. Leaders in the enterprise must effectively communicate to their employees about changing roles, reengineered processes, and new behaviors, as and when they make changes. They must reassure employees that generative AI is just a tool for extending human capabilities, and will not replace them. Although organizations are open to adopting generative AI, they often face certain challenges while doing so. Here are some of the most common challenges enterprises face while adapting GenAI. If your enterprise wants to step up with generative AI but is facing any of the above-mentioned challenges, Analytics Vidhya is here to help you.

The platform-as-a-solution streamlines interoperability and data integration between clinical systems and applications. It also manages cloud migration infrastructure, enabling providers to \"more quickly and easily connect distributed datasets, efficiently move workloads and information across cloud solutions and on-premise services.\" The company introduced the data integration engine to the country following increased demand for healthcare interoperability, particularly the HL7 FHIR data sharing standard.  WA Health extends cloud contract with Atos Atos will continue delivering managed services, hybrid cloud, and core infrastructure services to Health Support Services (HSS), the ICT service provider for WA Health, following a contract extension. The French IT company was recently awarded a contract worth A$242 M ($159 million) to continue supporting the digitalisation of the WA public health system for the next five years.  It has been working with HSS on the digital transformation of WA Health since 2019. That initial contract was for the delivery of private cloud, managed public cloud, hybrid cloud orchestration, co-location and managed services for over 2,000 servers, hosting of over 1,000 applications, and fully managed public cloud services utilising three hyperscalers. Victoria to complete Altera EMR rollout across Gippsland The state government of Victoria has committed to finishing the deployment of an integrated EMR system across the rural region of Gippsland.  It recently announced A$12 million in funding over four years to support health services in the region to upgrade their systems. This includes the rollout of Altera Digital Health's Sunrise EMR to remaining health services under the Gippsland Health Alliance (GHA): Gippsland Southern Health Service, Kooweerup Regional Health Service, Omeo District Health, Orbost Regional Health, South Gippsland Hospital, and Yarram and District Health Service. This comes almost a year after the GHA rolled out the EMR solution across major regional and subregional health services under its wing.  The GHA implementation, Altera claims, is the widest EMR deployment on Microsoft Azure in Australia. First go-live of cloud-based chemo prescribing solution in SA Altera has also started delivering an enterprise chemotherapy prescribing system to South Australian hospitals with a first go-live done at Lyell McEwin Hospital and Mount Gambier and Districts Health Service. In 2021, the company, which exclusively distributes the iQemo system in Australia and New Zealand, won the competitive tender to deliver the end-to-end solution, which includes predefined regimens, prescribing, scheduling and dispensing, and chemotherapy administration and reporting.  A rollout across regional hospitals and health centres is now underway with implementation at major sites such as Royal Adelaide and Flinders hospitals set for the first quarter of 2024.  Cubiko releases MyMedicare module GP intelligence platform Cubiko has introduced a new module to support clinics in their implementation of MyMedicare.  MyMedicare is a voluntary patient registration model launched by the Australian government as part of broader efforts to strengthen the Medicare insurance scheme.  In helping \"formalise\" the connection between patients and their GPs, the free MyMedicare module on Cubiko allows practices to directly import CSV lists of registered patients from MyMedicare in the Health Professional Online Services, doing away with the administrative burden of registering patients to their clinics manually. It also provides actionable insights into various patient cohorts.  Additionally, the module, which is available on the Cubiko Assist Dashboard, has tools that aid in identifying and enrolling patients with upcoming appointments who are eligible but not yet registered for MyMedicare.

                    "content": "The European Union (EU) is planning to extend proposed cybersecurity labelling rules that could affect major tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, as well as banks and airlines. The rules are designed to establish a certification scheme (EUCS) that verifies the cybersecurity of cloud services. The scheme will determine how businesses and governments in the EU select a vendor for their business. A potential boom in artificial intelligence after the viral success of OpenAI's ChatGPT could also boost demand for cloud services. ENISA, the EU cybersecurity agency, has proposed the latest draft of the certification scheme. Notably, the draft includes a requirement that U.S. tech giants set up a joint venture with an EU-based company to qualify for the EU cybersecurity label. Additionally, the draft states that cloud services must be operated and maintained from the EU, and all customer data must be stored and processed in the EU. EU laws will take precedence over non-EU laws regarding the cloud service provider. These obligations apply to the highest security level, with the possibility for these tough requirements to be extended to the third-highest security level. The latest draft is currently being reviewed by EU countries. Once reviewed, the European Commission will adopt a final scheme. Tech lobbying group CCIA has said that broadening the scope would affect a bigger swath of industries. Meanwhile, the European Banking Federation (EBF), together with the European Savings Banks Group (ESBG), the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), the European Payment Institutions Federation (EPIF), and Insurance Europe, have criticised the sovereignty requirements.",

An OpenAI spokesperson said that the message, sent by long-time executive Mira Murati, alerted staff to certain media stories without commenting on their accuracy.",
                    "content": "Ahead of CEO 's four days in exile, several staff researchers wrote a letter to the board of directors warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said could threaten humanity, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The previously unreported letter and AI algorithm were key developments before the board's ouster of Altman, the poster child of generative AI, the two sources said. Prior to his triumphant return late Tuesday, more than 700 employees had threatened to quit and join backer in solidarity with their fired leader. The sources cited the letter as one factor among a longer list of grievances by the board leading to Altman's firing, among which were concerns over commercializing advances before understanding the consequences. Reuters was unable to review a copy of the letter. The staff who wrote the letter did not respond to requests for comment. After being contacted by Reuters, OpenAI, which declined to comment, acknowledged in an internal message to staffers a project called Q* and a letter to the board before the weekend's events, one of the people said. An OpenAI spokesperson said that the message, sent by long-time executive Mira Murati, alerted staff to certain media stories without commenting on their accuracy. Some at OpenAI believe Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup's search for what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks. Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*'s future success, the source said. Reuters could not independently verify the capabilities of Q* claimed by the researchers. Researchers consider math to be a frontier of generative AI development. Currently, generative AI is good at writing and language translation by statistically predicting the next word, and answers to the same question can vary widely. But conquering the ability to do math - where there is only one right answer - implies AI would have greater reasoning capabilities resembling human intelligence. This could be applied to novel scientific research, for instance, AI researchers believe. Unlike a calculator that can solve a limited number of operations, AGI can generalize, learn and comprehend. In their letter to the board, researchers flagged AI's prowess and potential danger, the sources said without specifying the exact safety concerns noted in the letter. There has long been discussion among computer scientists about the danger posed by highly intelligent machines, for instance if they might decide that the destruction of humanity was in their interest. Researchers have also flagged work by an \"AI scientist\" team, the existence of which multiple sources confirmed. The group, formed by combining earlier \"Code Gen\" and \"Math Gen\" teams, was exploring how to optimize existing AI models to improve their reasoning and eventually perform scientific work, one of the people said. Altman led efforts to make ChatGPT one of the fastest growing software applications in history and drew investment - and computing resources - necessary from Microsoft to get closer to AGI. In addition to announcing a slew of new tools in a demonstration this month, Altman last week teased at a summit of world leaders in San Francisco that he believed major advances were in sight. \"Four times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks, I've gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honor of a lifetime,\" he said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. A day later, the board fired Altman.",

                    "content": "What just happened? PlayStation 5 has long won the game console battle against the Xbox Series X and S in terms of global sales, and a new report has now laid bare the extent of Microsoft's struggles. According to the latest data, PS5 sales in Europe (except the UK and Germany) grew 143 percent year-on-year last October, while Xbox Series S and X sales declined 52 percent. The report, which comes from GamesIndustry.Biz , revealed a similar month-on-month trend, with PS5 sales up 11 percent compared with September, while Xbox sales were down almost 20 percent. While Nintendo Switch sales in October were also up around 10 percent over the previous month, YoY figures show a 20 percent drop. Overall, 481,000 consoles are said to have been sold across the tracked markets in Europe last month. Console sales often depend on the popularity of exclusive titles, and all three major consoles got blockbuster new games over the past few weeks. While Starfield launched on the Xbox in September, Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros Wonder launched in October on the PS5 and the Switch, respectively. While all three games have been hits, Starfield's popularity doesn't seem to have helped Microsoft sell more consoles. Before Starfield, Microsoft struggled to roll out blockbuster titles on the Xbox Series X and S, with many of the exclusive games failing to enthuse gamers. A case in point is Halo Infinite, which was a major disappointment at launch, and although the later seasons have been praised by reviewers, it doesn't seem to have done anything for Xbox sales. Another notable failure was Redfall, which sank without a trace in the face of a barrage of criticism from players and reviewers alike. The report also revealed that the best-selling game in Europe last month was EA Sports' soccer title FC 24. While its sales numbers were 10 percent lower than last year's FIFA 23, most of that can be attributed to the brand name change (due to licensing issues) and excitement generated around the World Cup in Qatar last year. Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage was the second highest-selling title, while Sony's Spider-Man 2 also found a position on the podium.

                    "content": "Shemaroo Entertainment , a leading name in India’s media and entertainment industry, is set to venture into the metaverse through a strategic partnership with The Sandbox . The collaboration will give rise to BharatBox, a cultural hub within The Sandbox dedicated to showcasing iconic Bollywood figures and brands. This marks Shemaroo’s progressive leap into the digital realm, blending the richness of cinematic heritage with cutting-edge technology to introduce the Bollywood metaverse in BharatBox. The Sandbox is a Web3 gaming project that offers a virtual gaming world where users can build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences. It is a blockchain-based 3D virtual world game built on the Ethereum network, allowing players to explore, purchase land in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and build structures and experiences to earn income. Users own all in-game NFTs, which are verifiable on the blockchain, providing more opportunities for earning. Shemaroo Entertainment Ltd. is an Indian content creator, aggregator, and distributor in the media and entertainment industry. The company was founded in 1962 as a book-circulating library by the Maroo brothers (Buddhichand, Atul, and Raman) in collaboration with Gangajibhai Shethias. Having made its mark in the entertainment industry for over six decades, with renowned classics such as Jab We Met, The Great Gambler, Disco Dancer, Khuda Gawah, Blue, and 22 Yards, Shemaroo Entertainment is extending its influence into the metaverse with a focus on Digital Collectibles and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The partnership will offer fans a virtual playground where they can engage with their favorite characters. The virtual space will feature Bollywood space for hosting film launches, award ceremonies, live concerts, screenings, and other engaging activities. Gamers can groove to iconic steps, earning rewards and purchasing digital collectibles. Additionally, users will be exposed to a casino-themed gaming experience, underwater treasure hunt, cricket games, horse riding, and more. Arghya Chakravarty, COO at Shemaroo Entertainment Ltd., noted that the company is committed to embracing innovation and the future of entertainment through this alliance. Sebastien Borget, Co-founder and COO of The Sandbox, sees the partnership as a significant move for Shemaroo in expanding its metaverse experiences, bringing Bollywood and its millions of users into the metaverse for exciting new content. The CEO of BharatBox, Karan Keswani, believes in the collaboration with Shemaroo as a celebration of India’s rich cinematic history in a space that redefines the future.

The big day is finally here and there’s a mountain of great deals to chose from, including cheap PS5 and Xbox consoles and great Switch bundles. For the last couple of years Black Friday hasn’t been all that great for video games , as the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 were still brand new and there was no need for shops to offer a discount on the consoles (if they even had them in stock) or in many cases the games. Now that both have celebrated their third anniversary there’s a lot more bargains about, for both hardware and software, and so we’ve drawn up this master list of all the best deals. A lot of stores have the same prices, as they try and make sure nobody has the advantage over them, but you’ll find there’s usually one that’s always slightly cheaper. Black Friday started over a week ago for many retailers but there’ll probably still be some new deals today, so we’ll update this article if there are any good ones. If you notice any bargains we haven’t mentioned then do contact us via the email address at the bottom of the page. Likewise, if any of them change or go out of stock let us know and we’ll update the list.

This resulted from shareholders’ demands for change, including those of Microsoft. Even if OpenAI is rooted in a non-profit organization, the structure of the board determining the future of a for-profit company valued at $86 billion is not sustainable in America, a country of enterprises.No shareholder would blindly trust the goodwill and sense of mission of the few board members. The dramatic episode shows that a company cannot last without the support of the shareholders who share responsibility through investment.This situation is strangely familiar to us in Korea, where the foundation of “shareholder capitalism” is weak. In fact, the board that kicks out the founder, citing the mission of the organization, could be unfamiliar, but we are accustomed to a board that does not care about the interests of the shareholders.Article 382 of our Commercial Act does not require corporate board members to work for the “interests of the shareholders.” Instead, the law states that board members should be faithful to the “interests of the company.”Therefore, if the interests of major shareholders, including the owner, are packaged as the interests of the company — or even if shareholders suffer losses due to unqualified management — members of the board stay silent. There are countless examples in major companies like SK, LG and Kakao, which forced minor shareholders to sacrifice their own interests by dividing a parent company into subsidiaries and listing them.

But it is hard to expect more than a proclamatory effect. Commercial banks have had compliance officers for more than 20 years, but internal embezzlements of tens, hundreds of billions of won were not prevented.As a result, they did not have much to say when the president called banks “unethical” and the head of the Financial Supervisory Service ridiculed them by asking, “What innovations have the banks made?”But the shareholders cannot simply rely on the government’s rant. Rather than repeating the controversial “no short selling” mantra, how about establishing a mechanism for board directors to be faithful to the interests of shareholders? That would be a solution the president, who well knows the law, can offer.       주주 이길 이사회는 없다, 미국에선 박수련 IT산업부장     미국 실리콘밸리의 드라마 한 편에 전 세계가 닷새간 눈을 떼지 못했다. 챗GPT 개발사 ‘오픈AI’의 이사회가 최고경영자(CEO) 샘 올트먼을 기습 해고했지만, 결론은 올트먼의 화려한 복귀다. 석연치 않게 짤린 올트먼을 마이크로소프트(MS)로 즉각 영입한 사티아 나델라 MS CEO의 기민함, ‘샘이 복귀 안 하면 우리도 MS로 가겠다’며 이사회 퇴진을 관철시킨 직원들까지. 인류의 미래를 판돈으로 건 이 게임의 최대 변수는 기술 자체가 아니라 사람, 그리고 그 사람의 마음을 움직이는 리더십이란 걸 이 드라마는 보여주고 있다.     오픈AI의 새 이사회는 지배구조를 뜯어 고치겠다고 한다. MS를 비롯한 주주들이 이참에 변화를 요구한 결과다. 오픈AI가 비영리조직에 뿌리를 두고 있더라도, 주주들과 소통 않는 이사회가 기업가치 860억달러(약 111조5000억원)짜리 영리기업의 미래를 좌우하는 구조는 ‘기업의 나라’ 미국에선 애초에 지속되기 어려웠다. 소수 이사들의 선민 의식과 사명감을 마냥 믿어줄 주주는 없다. 투자를 통해 책임을 공유하는 주주들의 지지 없이는 기업이 지속될 수 없다는 걸 이 드라마는 보여주고 있다.     ‘주주 자본주의’ 토대가 약한 한국의 우리에게 이번 사태는 묘하게 익숙한 구석이 있다. 조직의 사명을 이유로 창업자를 쫓아내는 이사회는 낯설지만, 주주의 이익에 연연치 않는 이사회는 낯설지 않기 때문이다.     한국의 상법(382조)은 기업 이사들에게 ‘주주의 이익’을 위해 일하라고 요구하지 않는다. ‘회사의 이익’에 충실하라 할 뿐이다. 그렇다보니 대주주의 이익이 회사의 이익으로 포장돼도, 경영진의 자질 부족으로 주주들이 손해를 봐도 이사회는 조용하다. 물적분할 방식으로 자회사를 쪼개기 상장해 소액 주주들의 이익을 희생시킨 사례가 SK, LG, 카카오 등 대기업들에서 수두룩하게 나왔지만 어느 이사회가 여기에 제동을 걸었단 소식은 못 들었다.     일부 기업은 사법 리스크가 커지고 난 뒤에야 준법감시위원회 같은 별동대를 꾸려 신뢰 회복을 시도하지만 선언적 효과 이상을 기대하기는 어렵다. 은행들은 20년 이상 준법감시인을 뒀지만 수백억, 수천억 단위의 내부 횡령을 막지 못했다. 이러니 대통령이 특정 기업에 “ 부도덕하다”고 질타해도, 금융감독원장이 “은행들은 무슨 혁신을 했냐”고 조롱해도 할 말이 없는 것이다. 그렇다고 주주들이 정부의 호통에만 기댈 수도 없다. 논란의 ‘공매도 금지’ 카드를 반복하는 것보다, 이참에 기업 이사회가 주주의 이익에 충실하도록 장치를 마련하는 게 어떨까. 그게 법을 잘 아는 대통령의 해법 아닐지.",

MS를 비롯한 주주들이 이참에 변화를 요구한 결과다. 오픈AI가 비영리조직에 뿌리를 두고 있더라도, 주주들과 소통 않는 이사회가 기업가치 860억달러(약 111조5000억원)짜리 영리기업의 미래를 좌우하는 구조는 ‘기업의 나라’ 미국에선 애초에 지속되기 어려웠다. 소수 이사들의 선민 의식과 사명감을 마냥 믿어줄 주주는 없다. 투자를 통해 책임을 공유하는 주주들의 지지 없이는 기업이 지속될 수 없다는 걸 이 드라마는 보여주고 있다. ‘주주 자본주의’ 토대가 약한 한국의 우리에게 이번 사태는 묘하게 익숙한 구석이 있다. 조직의 사명을 이유로 창업자를 쫓아내는 이사회는 낯설지만, 주주의 이익에 연연치 않는 이사회는 낯설지 않기 때문이다. 한국의 상법(382조)은 기업 이사들에게 ‘주주의 이익’을 위해 일하라고 요구하지 않는다. ‘회사의 이익’에 충실하라 할 뿐이다. 그렇다보니 대주주의 이익이 회사의 이익으로 포장돼도, 경영진의 자질 부족으로 주주들이 손해를 봐도 이사회는 조용하다. 물적분할 방식으로 자회사를 쪼개기 상장해 소액 주주들의 이익을 희생시킨 사례가 SK, LG, 카카오 등 대기업들에서 수두룩하게 나왔지만 어느 이사회가 여기에 제동을 걸었단 소식은 못 들었다. 일부 기업은 사법 리스크가 커지고 난 뒤에야 준법감시위원회 같은 별동대를 꾸려 신뢰 회복을 시도하지만 선언적 효과 이상을 기대하기는 어렵다. 은행들은 20년 이상 준법감시인을 뒀지만 수백억, 수천억 단위의 내부 횡령을 막지 못했다. 이러니 대통령이 특정 기업에 “ 부도덕하다”고 질타해도, 금융감독원장이 “은행들은 무슨 혁신을 했냐”고 조롱해도 할 말이 없는 것이다. 그렇다고 주주들이 정부의 호통에만 기댈 수도 없다. 논란의 ‘공매도 금지’ 카드를 반복하는 것보다, 이참에 기업 이사회가 주주의 이익에 충실하도록 장치를 마련하는 게 어떨까. 그게 법을 잘 아는 대통령의 해법 아닐지.",

                    "content": "Swiss software developer first app was the end-to-end encrypted Proton Mail that launched in 2014. It’s a great alternative to Gmail, though having a Google account has its perks; Gmail is just one of Google’s many useful apps. The downside of using the free Google apps is that you pay for them with your data, which Google then monetizes with ads. You can create a free Proton Mail account, and you won’t have to pay for it with your privacy. Moreover, a Proton account gets you access to other apps the company has released since 2014. Best of all, they all offer the same end-to-end encryption as Mail. I recently, which I think is a good rival for 1Password and other password manager apps. But Proton Drive is the app that might make me finally switch over from Google. And Proton Drive just got a Mac app, which joins the Windows app released earlier this year. Proton now operates Mail, VPN, Calendar, Drive, SimpleLogin, and Pass apps. You get access to them with a free account, though I think the Premium subscription is the way to go. And with Black Friday sales, you get to save more money on 12-month deals. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the Proton Drive gets you 1GB of storage with your free account, while premium plans start at for 200GB of storage. Again, the one-year and two-year bundles are better deals, especially if you buy them . Also, the more expensive plans get you other perks across Proton apps. I said that Proton Drive would be a key app for my switching away from Google because we live in a world where cloud storage is mandatory. You get it with Apple once you create your Apple ID for the iPhone. Google offers cloud storage for Gmail and runs a standalone Google Drive app you can use. Similarly, Microsoft offers you OneDrive storage. Any cloud storage provider I’d consider has to offer apps for the devices I use. And since I’m a longtime Mac user, I appreciate the arrival of Proton Drive for Mac. Proton on Thursday. Proton also has apps Drive apps for Windows, iPhone, and Android. The Mac app should make file management even easier than using a web interface. Like all other Proton apps, and unlike other cloud storage rivals, Proton Drive is end-to-end encrypted. That’s a big reason to choose it as your cloud storage default for sensitive content and documents you wouldn’t want unprotected. Proton explains in the announcement that encryption happens on the device before the data is uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, nobody can see your data. Encryption also protects the metadata, so file names and dates aren’t available to anyone. As with other cloud storage apps, Proton Drive lets you sync files between your Mac and the cloud. And it lets you download the files you need when you need to have local copies. For now, the app will sync only the contents of the Proton Drive folder with the cloud storage. But in the future, Proton plans to let you sync any folder on your Mac with the cloud. The feature is available on Windows and should simplify saving data to the cloud. Proton Drive also offers another handy feature that could save you in a bind. It stores file edits as separate versions of that file. Therefore, it acts as a backup system, ensuring you won’t lose key changes or file versions. If you already have a Proton Mail account, you can use Proton Drive already. Maybe you’ve been using it for the past year. But make sure you download the Mac and/or Windows apps to make file transfers even easier.",

                    "content": "While a fair few brands and retailers launched their sales earlier this week, this year’s Black Friday has officially kicked off today. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the sheer amount of offers, we’re here to help you sort through wall-to-wall sales. To help you get right to the good stuff, we’ve collected the best Black Friday 2023 deals that are currently available for gaming, tech and more. This article has been updated since its original publication. What started out as a sale event to signify the start of the Christmas shopping season in the United States has exploded into an international phenomenon. Over the past decade, Australian retailers have begun to embrace the concept of Black Friday, with more and more jumping on board. What was once a distinctly American holiday has since become a term synonymous with deals and bargains. Black Friday normally takes place on the last Friday of November – which is November 24 this year – but as we can from the huge list of deals above, that date is more of a suggestion instead of a hard rule. Some retailers will offer some early-bird deals before Friday, or they’ll have their deals run throughout the weekend, and possibly into the following week. Time is a lie and nothing is real. The time difference between Australia and the United States is also an important factor at play here. We get to double-dip with Australian Black Friday deals, and then we can get some extra bargains when the U.S. deals start on Saturday. There’s also Cyber Monday, a similar sale event that is specifically focused on online retailers. It’ll be taking place on the Monday following Black Friday, November 27 . Depending on the retailer, there may be some deals exclusive to Cyber Monday only too. Check out more of Kotaku Australia’s Black Friday 2023 sale round-ups below: Image: TCL/istock/Girts Ragelis",

                    "content": "WTF?! It isn't just generative AI that occasionally gets things very wrong. Microsoft search engine Bing told some users yesterday that the country of Australia doesn't exist, repeating a jokey (to some) conspiracy theory that has been circulating online since 2017 – though its source could date back even further. Australian users of Bluesky and Mastodon were surprised yesterday to find Bing was informing them that the country they were in didn't actually exist. As reported by The Guardian , Microsoft's search engine was answering the unusual query about the world's sixth-largest country with an emphatic \"No.\" Bing stated this was according to several sources. The conspiracy theory about Australia's non-existence can reportedly be traced back to a user on the Flat Earth Society forum – where else – who said everything about the country was made up, pictures were faked, and anyone who claimed to be from there was really a secret government agent. One would imagine this was someone trolling, but who knows, given its source. A government spy? There was then a Facebook post that claimed Australia is \"one of the biggest hoaxes ever created,\" a conspiracy thought up by the British to make people think that criminals were sent there instead of being thrown into the sea. \"It's a coverup for one of the greatest mass murders in history, made by one of the most prominent empires... Australia is not real. It's a codeword for the cold blooded murder of more than a hundred thousand people, and it is not okay. We will not, accept this. Stand up for the ones who died. Let it be known, that Australia does not exist,\" the post read. It was deleted after the author received 100 or so death threats from angry Australians. We're used to seeing these sorts of factually incorrect and just plain weird statements spouted by generative AIs, but what's most surprising about all this is that Bing co-pilot, formerly Bing Chat, confirmed Australia is real. It also noted that there are conspiracy theories surrounding the country's existence, but these are not true and have been debunked. A spokesperson for Microsoft said the Bing issue had been addressed. \"Thank you for bringing this to our attention,\" the spokesperson said. \"We've investigated this query and have rolled out a fix to address it.\" Anyone who believes that the land down under isn't real will probably see Bing's error as further proof, tragically. However, our own Steve Walton and Tim Schiesser will likely have something to say about that.

The easiest solution for this issue, which is also recommended by Microsoft, is to attempt to fix your potentially corrupted local Windows image file. Type “Command Prompt” in Windows Search, and click Run as administrator on the right to open an elevated cmd. In the User Account Control prompt, press Yes . Type the following command, then press Enter . The process may take a few minutes, so make sure you don’t interrupt it. Once it’s done, reboot your system, and try again to reset your PC. If Microsoft’s workaround hasn’t helped you deal with the issue, you may want to try initiating a reset from the Windows RE (Recovery Environment). If you’re using Windows 11, navigate to Settings -> System -> Recovery . Click the Restart Now button next to Advanced Startup , then click Restart Now once again in the pop-up. On Windows 10, you’ll find the same option by going to Settings -> Update & Security -> Recovery and the Restart now button under Advanced startup . Go to Troubleshoot -> Reset this PC to initiate the process. Tip : seeing the “Something didn’t go as planned” error as you’re trying to update Windows? Learn how to fix it. If system files on your PC have become corrupted over time, it could be the reason you are experiencing issues when attempting to reset your PC. Counter this by performing an SFC scan. From an elevated Command Prompt window, type the following command, then press Enter . Allow the tool to scan for any missing, corrupt system files. If it finds any, it will repair them. Restart your PC, and retry resetting your device. If the Windows RE is not functioning properly, it may cause the “There was a problem resetting your PC” error. The solution is to restart the service. Open a Command Prompt with elevated permissions, and type the following command: Reboot your PC. Open cmd again, and enter this command: Check whether you can reset your PC as needed. FYI : learn how to check your PC’s specs when the needed arises. Issues with the Windows startup may be prohibiting your system from starting the reset process on your PC. As a result, try using the Windows Startup Repair tool to patch any problems. Access the Windows RE as previously explained, but this time go to Troubleshoot -> Advanced Options , and select Startup Repair to initiate the process. If you’ve previously created a restore point, use it now to revert your system to an earlier state when the issue wasn’t manifesting. Performing a system restore will effectively undo changes you recently made to your PC, which may be at fault for the “There was a problem resetting your PC” error. Reverting your device to a restore point will not impact your files but will remove any apps, drivers or updates installed after that particular restore point was generated. Check out our post to learn how to get started initiating a System Restore on your PC. Tip : if System Restore is not working as intended, try these tips to start using it. If none of the methods detailed so far have worked for you, you may have to do a clean install. Since the original aim was to reinstall Windows anyway, why not install a fresh copy? Keep in mind that doing so will wipe all your data, including files, apps and other data, so creating a backup may be in order. An easy way to reinstall the operating system is with your preferred Windows version on a disc or flash drive . If you’re not sure how to get started with that, our guide has all the steps, as well as alternative options to install Windows on your device. Tip : did you know that you can install Windows 11 even on unsupported devices ? Learn how to do it. Many things can go wrong on your Windows computer, but it’s important not to panic, as there is usually a way to address these problems. For instance, if you discover that your power menu is missing, learn how to troubleshoot the “There are currently no power options available” error . Alternatively, learn what to do if your taskbar has stopped working . Image credit: Freepik . All screenshots by Alexandra Arici.

                    "description": "Techies are already inventing a terrifying Terminator-like Skynet which could wipe out humanity, with ChatGPT rumblings and a superintelligence disaster waiting to happen",
                    "content": "Techies have invented a version of The Terminator's deadly Skynet which could wipe out humanity for real. Open AI staff warned its board about a powerful breakthrough that could pose a threat to the human race before chief executive officer Sam Altman was fired then later rehired. Several researchers sent a letter to the directors warning the progress made on Project Q had the potential to endanger humanity. The letter ultimately led to the removal of Altman - the creator of ChatGPT - and five days of chaos within the company. Altman had made progress on Q which some internal sources believe could be a breakthrough in the firm's search for superintelligence. The company defines superintelligence - also known as artificial general intelligence - as AI systems that are smarter than humans. In The Terminator movie series fictional superintelligent AI network Skynet gained self-awareness and launched a nuclear attack after humans tried to deactivate it. OpenAI's chief technology officer Mira Murati, who stepped in as interim CEO after Altman's axing, told employees a letter had been sent to the board prior to the move and mentioned Q. Sources cited the letter as one of a n umber of factors leading to his firing. Altman, OpenAI and researchers who wrote the letter have not commented on it. News of the letter came after SpaceX, Tesla and X - formerly known as Twitter - chief Elon Musk posted online another not accusing Altman and his co-founder Greg Brockman of creating a hostile work environment. The letter - allegedly penned by former OpenAI employees - detailed \"dishonest\" and \"manipulative\" leadership. Its writers claimed a significant number of OpenAI employees were pushed out of the company to facilitate its transition to a for-profit model. \"Their methods, however, have raised serious doubts about their true intentions and the extent to which they genuinely prioritize the benefit of humanity,'' the letter read. It accused employees who remain at OpenAI of \"blindly\" following Altman and Brockman's leadership \"even at significant personal cost. This unwavering loyalty stems from a combination of fear of retribution and the allure of potential financial gains through OpenAI's profit participation units. The letter ended by asking the newly-appointed board of directors to take a firm stand against these unethical practices and launch an independent investigation into Sam and Greg's conduct'. \"The future of artificial intelligence and the well-being of humanity depend on your unwavering commitment to ethical leadership and transparency,'' it added. Musk, who fell out with Altman several years ago about the leadership of the company, wrote: \"These seem like concerns worth investigating.'' When Altman, 38, was ousted last weekend 747 of the company's 770 staff threatened to quit and follow their leader to Microsoft where he was headed at the time. Five days later he returned an OpenAI's CEO. Altman tweeted: \"I love OpenAI and everything I've done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together.'' Microsoft chairman. and chief executive officer Satya Nadella said changes in the OpenAI board had led to Altman's return. \"We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance,'' he said. \"Sam, Greg, and I have talked and agreed they have a key role to play along with the OAI leadership team in ensuring OAI continues to thrive and build on its mission. \"We look forward to building on our strong partnership and delivering the value of this next generation of AI to our customers and partners.'' OpenAI confirmed Altman had returned and the company had appointed a new initial board'. Founded by Altman and 10 others - including Musk - in 2015 OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT a year ago. Its ability to mimic human writing has polarised politicians, the public and the rest of the AI industry. Musk, who was forced to quit after a failed attempt to take control of the company, has since attacked AI as 'woke' and claimed it deviates from OpenAI's original non-profit mission. The billionaire tweeted in February: \"OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it 'Open' AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.'' He signed a letter calling for a pause in the \"dangerous race\" to develop AI which he fears poses a \"profound risk to society and humanity\" and could have \"catastrophic\" effects. OpenAI execs have said theybelieve in the responsible creation and use of these AI systems'.",

                    "description": "When you set up a new Windows PC, you have a choice of four types of user accounts, from the old-school local account to the newest, Microsoft Entra ID (fka Azure Active Directory). Here's how to decide.",
                    "content": "Ed Bott explains the pros and cons of each account type and why your best option might be a combination of two account types. When you set up a Windows PC for the first time, you're required to create a user account that will allow you to act as the administrator for that computer. Depending on your Windows edition and network setup, you have a choice of up to four separate account types. On business editions (Pro, Pro for Workstations, Enterprise, and Education), the Windows Setup program asks you to choose whether you want to set the PC up for personal use or for use on a network managed by your organization, as shown below. If you choose the second option, you can set up the PC using an account in your Windows Active Directory domain or you can sign in using an Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) account, such as the one associated with a Microsoft 365 Business or Enterprise subscription. (A quick note here: Microsoft announced the change of name to in July 2023, and as is always the case, it takes a long, long time for the change to ripple through every part of the system, which mean you will see frequent references to Azure AD in documentation and some management tools. The feature set remains the same, regardless of the name.) This choice is only available with Windows Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions On Windows Home edition, that choice isn't available, and you're limited to only the two personal options: a local account or a Microsoft account. The Setup program is extremely persistent about trying to coax you into signing in with a Microsoft account. Current versions of Windows 11, in fact, offer only the option to use a Microsoft account, although you can work around this restriction with some tricks I explain later in this post. You can also install a Microsoft account as the primary account and then add a local account (or remove the connection to the Microsoft account) after you've signed in for the first time. Let's look at the pros and cons of each account type. Your best option might be a combination of two account types. Microsoft account This is Microsoft's free online account for personal use, required for signing into the company's consumer services, including OneDrive, Xbox Live, Skype, and Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscriptions, among others. If you have an email account at Outlook.com or Hotmail.com (or, for old-timers, at live.com or msn.com), you already have a Microsoft account. You can also sign up for a new account anytime, choosing a new address at Outlook.com or using your own email address. Signing in to your Windows 10 or Windows 11 PC with a Microsoft account offers several distinct benefits: On PCs designed for Windows 10 or Windows 11, signing in with a Microsoft account automatically enables , even on systems running Home edition. If you turn on BitLocker encryption (Pro and Enterprise editions only), your recovery key is stored in OneDrive, allowing you to access your data if you find yourself locked out. Signing in with a Microsoft account stores a record of your successful activation, allowing you to easily restore your activation (no product key required) if you have to reinstall Windows after making significant hardware changes. Windows allows you to sync settings between PCs where you sign in using the same Microsoft account. That includes personalization settings like your desktop background, saved passwords (including Wi-Fi profiles), language and regional settings, and more. (For a full list, see ) You can sign in automatically to any Microsoft consumer service using your saved Microsoft Account credentials. You can sync data and settings for preinstalled Windows apps (Mail and Calendar, for example) and easily restore apps you download from the Store. Note that Windows telemetry data is tied to your device and isn't associated with a Microsoft account. (For more details on how telemetry works, see ) And, of course, you can create a Microsoft account and use it exclusively for signing in to Windows while keeping your email, cloud storage, and other services elsewhere. But if you do use a Microsoft account for services such as Microsoft 365 and OneDrive, it makes sense to sign in to Windows using the same account. Local account A local account is about as old school as Windows gets. You don't need a network connection or an email address; instead, you create a username (up to 20 characters) and a password, both of which are stored on the PC where you create them. Those credentials grant access only to the device on which you created them. There's no particular security or privacy advantage to signing in with a local account (indeed, the lack of device encryption is a negative, in my book); but if that's your preference, you can do so when you set up Windows on a new PC. Windows 11 Home requires you to sign in with a Microsoft account during initial setup. Beginning with version 22H2, so does Windows 11 Pro when you choose the option to set it up for personal use. You can work around this restriction by entering the address as your Microsoft account. When you're asked for a password, enter anything. Windows will inform you that the account has been locked because of too many incorrect password attempts (you're not the first person to do this, after all), and you'll be given the option to create a local account instead. If you've already created a new account that's associated with a Microsoft account, you can easily convert it to a local account. After signing in for the first time, go to Settings > Accounts > Your Info. Under the Account Settings heading, choose Sign In With A Local Account Instead and follow the prompts. On Windows 10, make sure you're not connected to the internet when you run Setup; then, when you reach the Sign In With Microsoft screen shown here, click the \"Continue with limited setup\" option in the lower left corner. That option in the lower left corner allows you to set up a local account on a Windows 10 PC. After you get past those speed bumps, you can enter your username and password. With a Microsoft account, you have multiple options to recover if you forget your password. With local accounts, you've historically had no such option if you forget your password. Setting up a local account requires that you fill in answers to three security questions, to help you recover in the event you forget your password. You can't bypass those questions, nor can you choose alternatives other than the six predefined questions. If you're worried that a thief with a search engine can guess those answers, do as I do and ... be creative. For example, you can answer the three security questions with a three-word passphrase of your own, entered one word at a time. Or, if you'd prefer to bypass the whole feature, just mash the keyboard to create random \"answers\" that no one (including you) could possibly guess. If you choose either option, don't blame me if you forget your password. You can switch at will between a local account and a Microsoft account, using options in > > . Even if you prefer a local account, consider signing in first with a Microsoft account. After you confirm that your system is properly activated and the activation status is recorded with that Microsoft account, switch back to a local account and go on about your business. Likewise, if you're fussy about the name of your default user profile folder, consider signing in with a local account first, and then attach your Microsoft account. If you follow that procedure, Windows uses the exact local username you specify as the folder name and retains that name when you switch; if you start with a Microsoft account, your user profile folder name is the first five characters of the portion of your email address to the left of the @ sign. Active Directory (domain join) If your company has an enterprise network with a Windows server running as a domain controller, you can join a Windows 10 or Windows 11 PC to the domain. Creating that type of account requires that a domain administrator create an Active Directory account, after which you can sign in using those credentials in the format (or , if the domain is associated with a fully qualified domain name). Ironically, before you can join a PC to a domain and sign in with your Active Directory account, you have to first create a local account. Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) This is the newest option in the lineup of Windows account types. Like a domain account, an Entra ID account is managed by an organization's administrator, but it doesn't require a local server. Instead, the credentials are managed in Microsoft's Azure cloud. If your organization uses Microsoft 365 or has an Office 365 Business or Enterprise subscription, you already have a Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD account. As with a Microsoft account, you sign in using an email address as your username (in this case, the address is assigned by your organization and managed by their IT staff); this account type gives you the ability to sync settings across devices where you're signed in with the same account. The big difference is that your access to the device is managed by your organization's administrator, who can apply security settings and restrict some options. To manage Microsoft Entra ID accounts, administrators use the , which also includes the option to synchronize the cloud-based directory with a local domain's Active Directory, an option called Microsoft Entra Connect. Entra ID is the new name for what used to be called Azure AD. A basic Entra ID account is free, but like all Microsoft enterprise services, upsell options abound. Paying for a premium account (which is included with a Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 subscription) unlocks advanced security features. And you can mix and match account types on the same device for the sake of flexibility. You might want a local account to handle routine administrative tasks, a Microsoft account for personal use, and an Entra ID account for connecting to your organization's servers. To set up additional accounts after the first one, use > > > (Windows 10) or > > > (Windows 11). Just choose the right account when you first sign in to a new session.",

                    "content": "There is no doubt that private jets offer the most exclusive and comfortable way to travel around the world. This has become a necessity for many celebrities, including artists, social media personalities, actors, athletes, and successful business owners. After purchasing them for millions of dollars, owners spend even more customizing them with unique liveries and lavish interior features. Many celebrities have shared pictures and videos of their private jets, so let's look at some of the most impressive. American actor and film producer John Travolta has , which any avgeek can't help but admire. In addition to being a famous Hollywood actor, Travolta is also known for his love for aviation. He is a certified pilot, type rated on at least 11 aircraft, some of which are among the world's most famous models. Before we go further, let us break down John Travolta's fleet. One One Three One One Perhaps one of the most fantastic aircraft he owned was the Boeing 707-138B. He picked up the 150-seat quadjet from Qantas over 20 years ago. It was initially through a rental agreement, but the airline later gave it to him as part of his deal as the brand ambassador. It was customized into a luxury private jet that accommodates about 15 passengers and featured two bedrooms and a full-size bathroom. The 57-year-old Boeing aircraft was donated to Australia's Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) in 2017 for renovation and display. Travolta also owned a Canadair CL41 Tutor, later donated to a university, as well as a Lockheed Jetstar, which he later sold. His private mansion in Ocala, Florida, is also admired by many. It sits on a 0.86 sq mi (2.07 sq km) piece of land and has access to two runways at Greystone Airport in the Jumbolair Aviation Estates. Sticking with larger aircraft, the Canadian rapper Drake has a private Boeing 767-200ER, registration N767CJ. Actually, it is owned by Ontario-based Cargojet but was given to the artist as part of a free-publicity deal for the airfreight company. The 767, dubbed \"Air Drake,\" is luxuriously fitted with velvet sofas, a fully carpeted floor, gold and wood surfaces, a full-mirror wall, an entertainment room, and three fully enclosed private suites. Here are some of its specifications. Boeing 767-200ER 27.19 years 45 passengers $200 million The widebody is customized with Drake's own livery, designed by the late Louis Vuitton Creative Director Virgil Abloh. The tail section is painted with the October's Very Own (OVO) logo - the artist's umbrella company. Cargojet reportedly spent between 80 and 100 million dollars on customizing it, giving it a value of around $200 million. It can accommodate up to 45 passengers in an all-business setting. This type of widebody would otherwise accommodate over 200 passengers in a commercial airline configuration. Tom Cruise is another famous Hollywood actor who is a serious aviation enthusiast. His interest in planes extends beyond what we have seen in the Top Gun and Mission Impossible movies. He owns at least two private aircraft - the first is a Gulfstream IV jet. This aircraft is one of the classic early private jets from the manufacturer, produced from 1985. , fitted with a jacuzzi and a dedicated movie screening room, and Cruise also owns a classic P-51 Mustang aircraft. The iconic fighter was built in 1946, just after the Second World War, and Cruise bought it in 2001. This was one of the aircraft that flew in the May 2022 Top Gun: Maverick movie. Like John Travolta, the actor is also a licensed pilot capable of flying several types. While many celebrities own business jets, Oprah Winfrey stands out for possessing one of the latest and most expensive, valued at around $75 million. She owns a Gulfstream G650. This long-range aircraft can accommodate up to 16 passengers and is currently one of the best business jets on the market. Oprah became a Gulfstream customer in 2013 after replacing her Bombardier Global Express with a Gulfstream G550. She acquired the newer G650 in 2016. She is reported to have spent around $10 million on top of the aircraft's price . Unlike other celebrities, Oprah does not post many images of her luxury aircraft online. However, the G650 is large enough to accommodate about 12 to 18 passengers and has space for sleeping areas, a full galley area, and a bathroom. Unsurprisingly, the world's richest man (in November 2023 at least) also owns one of the best private jets. Elon Musk also has a private Gulfstream G650 (registration N628TS) with an estimated listed price of $70 million. Fellow business mogul and Amazon founder Jett Bezos also owns a Gulfstream G650 jet. Musk has owned the G650 since 2016, and it was this aircraft that saw Musk . He is reportedly planning to upgrade to the newest Gulfstream G700 jet soon. Musk's G650 is fitted with the latest technology. It also features private bathrooms, spacious living areas, and state-of-the-art entertainment systems. It is tough at the top, though. His rival for the wealthiest person in the world, LVMH founder and CEO Bernard Arnault, sold his private jet in 2022 following increasing attention from activists and flight trackers. As per multiple reports, Elon Musk owns an additional three private jets. With his presidency and frequent media coverage of his life afterward, Donald Trump's private jet is frequently seen. Trump has gone much larger than the standard private jet with his own Boeing 757. This unit, in particular, was purchased from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 2011. Boeing 757-200 32.53 years 43 passengers $100 million The three-decade-old 757, dubbed \"Trump Force One,\" reportedly cost the former US president about $100 million. The aircraft has two bedrooms, a lounge and dining area, and a meeting space and can accommodate up to 43 passengers. There are reportedly leather seats, Waterford crystal lamps, and gold-plated seatbelt buckles. The aircraft took a three-year break while Trump primarily used the plane commonly referred to as \"Air Force One\" during his presidency, but was with a new paint job. Another celebrity who has opted for big jets is Mark Cuban. The internet businessman, Shark Tank investor, and owner of the Dallas Mavericks has two private aircraft. These are a Gulfstream G550 and a Boeing 757-200. He purchased the Gulfstream jet online in 1999. At $40 million, . The Boeing 757 is used for team transport and reportedly has been fitted out with a weight room, special meeting set-ups, space for medical treatments, and coaching and connectivity resources. Cuban previously owned a widebody Boeing 767 aircraft, too. This was used by the team, as well as for private charter. But that aircraft was withdrawn and scrapped in 2021, however. Despite being the largest online transaction at the time, the purchase of his G550 was also very interesting for another reason. In an interview with Business Jet Traveler, Cuban said he emailed Gulfstream, which arranged a demo flight for his pilot. The pilot was happy with the aircraft, and the deal was completed without Cuban ever stepping onto it. Among the Gulfstream owners, basketball legend Michael Jordan's G550 has by far one of the most striking liveries. He acquired it in August 2016 for a whopping $61.5 million and make his personal flying life more comfortable. At the time, he repainted it in the powder blue and white color scheme of his North Carolina Tar Heels basketball team. It now sports the unique black, gray, and white elephant print seen on Air Jordan sneakers. The tail section also features the iconic Jumpman logo - a silhouette of the six-foot-six basketball legend. He also made significant changes to the interior, fitting the G550 with premium leather recliner seats, a bar and cigar station, state-of-the-art entertainment systems, and a private bathroom. Here are some of the aircraft's key specifications: Crew Two Capacity 14 - 19 passengers Range 6,750 NM (12,500 km) Fuel capacity 41,300 lb (18,733 kg) Service ceiling 51,000 ft (16,000 m) Interested in finding out more about private aviation? American socialite and businesswoman Kylie Jenner may not own the most expensive or unusual private jet, but she certainly has made headlines with usage. In 2020, Stratos Jet Charters business jet user globally. To put it into context, she competed with Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, and Angela Merkel, who topped the list. She owns a Bombardier BD-700 Global Express. This was built in 2019 and is registered N810KJ. As a socialite, Kylie regularly posts about her lifestyle online, generating mixed reactions. Criticism of her excessive jet use and seemingly dismissive treatment of its environmental impact shows well the shift in attitudes towards celebrities and their private travel. Unsurprisingly, as an influential social media personality, Kylie would post several pictures of her private jet online. The Bombardier aircraft sports a custom white livery with pink stripes around parts of the fuselage and tail—the interior features plush gray seats, pink pillows, pink mood lighting, and a spacious wardrobe. The singer owns two Dassault private jets. - the most up-to-date variant of the Falcon 900. She purchased the aircraft for around $40 million in 2011. It previously had the number 13 painted by the nose - unlucky for some; Swift has an affinity for the number 13 for several reasons, including her birthday (December 13th) and her debut album going Gold in 13 weeks. Her other jet is a Falcon 7X (registration N621MM). Like Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift has attracted adverse attention over jet use. Swift was alleged to have made around 170 private jet trips in just seven months in 2022, but by pointing out that Swift rents out her jet when not in use. According to Dassault Aviation, the Falcon 900LX can set about 12 to 14 passengers in a 92-inch (233-cm) wide and 74-inch (188-cm) tall cabin. It has a range of up to 4,750 NM (8,797 km). There are several other celebrities with incredible private jets. Another notable individual is Cristiano Ronaldo, who owns a $65.5 million Gulfstream G650 and a $25 million Gulfstream G200. His long-time rival, Lionel Messi, . Other celebrities include Bill Gates, Jim Carey, Rick Ross, and Tiger Woods.",

                    "content": "The 2020s will be the semiconductor decade as chip prevalence across industrial and consumer applications increases. Top semiconductor stocks reflect this positive outlook, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH ) surging 61% year-to-date. For investors with a long-term view, more gains lie ahead. The advent of generative AI has triggered an arms race. Companies are rushing to train large language models on large datasets, resulting in demand for sophisticated graphic processing units that can handle AI workloads has soared. Smart devices such as virtual assistants and thermostats require advanced chips to process information, and even traditional applications such as motor vehicles and industrial machinery use more chips. The following companies are key players in the semiconductor ecosystem. They are highly profitable leaders that generate enormous free cash flows. Indeed, they will power technology and innovation for the next decade. Nvidia (NVDA) With artificial intelligence in everyone’s mouths, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has become one of the most important global companies . For generative AI applications to work, they rely on training done on large language models. Nvidia designs high-level graphic processing units for AI processing and training. Its Nvidia A100 chips have become digital gold as companies contemplate how to apply AI to their business processes. Demand from cloud service providers such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has soared, since they have to upgrade their infrastructure services to suit AI applications. Due to the soaring demand, Nvidia revenues and stock have skyrocketed. Despite these its continued highs, the stock is one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy today. CEO Jensen Huang argues that AI has created a paradigm shift. Every company will now have to develop applications using an AI-first lens. Therefore, the data center will have a $1 trillion upgrade cycle . Cloud service providers will have to replace older chips that are unsuitable for AI applications. As of this writing, Nvidia trades at 45 times fiscal year 2024 EPS. Consensus estimates predict 101% and 47% revenue growth in fiscal year 2024 and 2025, respectively. NVDA stock is a buy, considering its long-term growth potential as the multiyear data center replacement cycle takes shape. Arm Holdings (ARM) Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM ) is a recent IPO with much promise. The company mainly licenses its energy-efficient CPUs and related technologies to semiconductor companies. Companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) use its chip design architecture. In prior years, over 50% of Arm Holdings’ revenue has come from royalties from smartphones and consumer electronics. Its architecture enables the design of power-efficient chips. As we advance, the company will be a crucial player in artificial intelligence chip design. Recent quarterly results highlighted the potential as revenues surged due to investments in artificial intelligence. Total revenues were up 28% year-over-year. “Licensing revenue was up over 100% year-over-year as the demand for AI has kicked off increased investment across all end markets,” said Rene Haas, CEO. The company is benefiting as AI chips increase the need for performance and power efficiency. Semiconductor companies are relying on Arm’s latest technologies to design high-performance chips for applications such as cloud computing and automotive. Arm technology touches many applications such as smartphones, cloud computing, automotive and IoT. With artificial intelligence, there are more compute requirements. Companies are working with ARM to deliver power-efficient chips. For instance, it’s working with Nvidia for its Grace Hopper Superchip . Over the next decade, ARM will see tremendous growth from the AI, the cloud and applications such as automotive. Notably, its royalty model allows for higher gross margins and profits since it only designs the chips. The secular growth and best-in-class margins make ARM one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Although the semiconductor industry has tremendous growth ahead, it can be very competitive. A chip designer’s technology can quickly become obsolete from new competition. Therefore, buying foundries that manufacture semis for fabless semiconductor companies can be a better strategy than betting on the designers. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ) is the largest semiconductor foundry in the world. The company doesn’t design chips. Instead, it manufactures semiconductors for various companies. Semiconductor designers such as Apple, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) and Nvidia rely on the company to produce and package its chips. The company has concentrated on semiconductor manufacturing for decades. Due to its technology leadership in the manufacturing process, it is one of the top semiconductor stocks. The company can manufacture some of the most miniature and sophisticated chips. Through the years, the company has remained a leader in node advancement. Today, Taiwan Semi can manufacture high-performance and smaller chips at the lowest cost. It maintains a massive technological advantage over smaller foundries such as GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS ) and United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE: UMC ). Notably, it manufactures 5nm chips that these competitors can’t. As artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and IoT applications grow, the company’s foundry business could grow for decades. The recent revenue growth in October was a positive for the stock. Increasing demand from Apple’s new iPhone and artificial intelligence spurred growth. At a price-to-earnings of 19, TSM stock is a buy, considering the substantial growth ahead.

The game is available on a variety of platforms, including PCs, consoles, and mobile devices. It’s been a long time coming. When Microsoft acquired Sweden-based Minecraft maker Mojang in 2014 for $2.5 billion, the stake was high. The game finally reached 100 million registered users by 2014, and 200 million more in “only” nine years’ time. The popular 3D sandbox adventure game is also known for its numerous collaborations with popular brands, including Barbie-maker Mattel. The partnership between the two went back to at least 2014, making over $200 million in revenue. You can download Minecraft for Windows desktops on the Microsoft Store.",

For the Best Black Friday deals of 2023, be sure to check out Forbes Vetted’s main page. Forbes Vetted For You The Best Gaming Mouse That’ll Improve Your Aim By Jon Martindale Contributor 1. HyperX Cloud III Wireless Cloud III Wireless Credit: HyperX HyperX has been my go-to gaming headset brand for years now. My favorite headset of all time is actually the HyperX Cloud II Wireless headset ( $99.99 on Amazon @ 33% off ). Having tested the II and the III, I’m sticking with the II for a number of reasons including the fact that it just fits my big dome better. It also tells you, outloud, how much battery you have left which I’ve really come to enjoy. But the Cloud III Wireless is excellent also and boasts an even longer battery life. It’s tough, comfortable and has great noise-cancelling. You really can’t go wrong with either of these headsets. Both boast top-notch mics as well. $129.99 on Amazon (24% off) 2. RIG 800 PRO HX RIG 800 PRO HX Credit: RIG I actually tested out the cheaper RIG 600 PRO HX and found the sound quality quite excellent. It’s a very comfortable headset as well, and comes with a handy charging station. The reason I’m including the 800 in this list is that it’s an even nicer headset and, right now, is on sale for the exact same price as the 600 series. This is officially licensed for Xbox and PC, has Dolby Atmos 3D Surround Sound and clocks in at 24 hours of battery time, which isn’t bad at all. $99.99 on Amazon (33% off) 3. Secret Labs TITAN Evo Gaming Chair Titan EVO Gaming Chair Credit: Secret Labs I’m currently typing out this list while sitting on the chair in this picture. I’ve sat in a lot of different gaming chairs over the years, but my go-to since forever ago has been Secret Labs’ TITAN Evo, which is big and sturdy and comfortable and fits my 6’3” frame perfectly. I’m also a huge fan of The Witcher games, books and (season 1 of) the Netflix show. So this is basically a dream gaming chair. Over at the Secret Labs website you can find some good Black Friday deals, including up to $100 off on these bad boys. 4. Samsung 49” (5120x1440) Gaming Monitor Gaming Monitor Credit: Samsung You ever hear the phrase “go big or go home”? Yeah, that phrase was invented for this gaming monitor from Samsung. At 49” of curved, 120Hz QLED, HDR goodness, this thing will blow your mind, though at 33% off ( $799 at Amazon ) maybe not your budget. Of course, if you do plan on gaming at this high of a resolution, you probably want a graphics card that can go along with it. Which brings us to our next item in this list. 5. ASUS ROG Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti RTX 4070 Ti Credit: ASUS I’m a lifelong Nvidia gamer, having built my first PC with an Nvidia graphics card and almost every single one after that as well. I’m currently running an RTX 4070 which is terrific, making use of DLSS 3.0, ray-tracing and doing it all with a smaller footprint and less power draw than my previous RTX 3080. The 4070 Ti is even faster and will absolutely run just about any game you can throw at it with settings cranked to the max (even using that crazy Samsung monitor up above). This card is currently 14% off at $899.99 on Amazon. 6. Razer Basilisk V3 Ergonomic Gaming Mouse Razer Basilisk Credit: Razer I suppose we all pick our favorite brands over the years, and I’ve always been partial to Razer. The Razer Basilisk V3 is designed to be as comfortable as possible, which I find more important than ever as I get older and encounter fun ways the body can betray you like carpal tunnel syndrome. Fun! But this is a mouse for all ages, and the great user reviews combined with the current 43% off savings ( $39.99 on Amazon ) make it a great purchase for your own gaming or as a gift this holiday season. 7. HyperX Alloy Origins Mechanical Gaming Keyboard HyperX Alloy Origins Gaming Mechanical Keyboard Credit: HyperX Along with HyperX’s gaming headsets, I’ve become a diehard fan of the company’s excellent, colorful gaming keyboards. I love a good mechanical keyboard, and I’m typing on this terrific Alloy Origins keyboard as we speak. This is a solid, weighty, space-efficient keyboard that doesn’t sacrifice features for its smaller footprint. You have a 10-key, RGB lighting, and HyperX Mechanical Switches in either Red (quiet, non-tactile), Aqua (quiet, more of a tactile response) or Blue (clicky, tactile, loud) depending on your preference. On Amazon, over 11,000 user reviews have this keyboard at 4.7 stars, which says pretty much everything you need to know about its quality. It’s 18% off at $89.99 right now . 8. PS5 Slim Spider-Man 2 Bundle PS5 Slim Credit: Sony The PS5 Slim is a new edition to the PlayStation 5 lineup and cuts the size of the rather massive PS5 by a shocking amount. This little guy is just way, way smaller and easier to fit in your home entertainment setup. This particular bundle— $499 on Amazon , which basically means you get Spider-Man 2 for free—is perfect if you’re looking to get a great console with one of the very best games of the year. 9. Xbox Series X Gamepad Xbox Gamepad Credit: Microsoft As much as I love the PS5 and its DualSense gamepads, I’ve always been more of a fan of the Xbox controllers, and the Xbox Series X gamepads are the best they’ve ever been. And hey, look at this lovely Astral Purple color! That’s pretty sexy. I love all my consoles, but I’m mostly a PC gamer and I love using the Xbox Series X gamepad when I play games like Dark Souls or Elden Ring on my PC. (Keyboard and mouse for shooters, gamepad for action titles and platformers!) This is 31% off at $44.99 on Amazon right now . 10. LG OLED C3 Series 77” Television LG OLED Credit: LG If you’re looking for a new TV to game on or just to stream your favorite shows and movies, I can’t recommend LG’s OLED line highly enough. I own two LG OLED television sets (55” in my bedroom, 65” in my TV room) and I’m tempted to upgrade to an even larger set, though that’s basically crazy and greedy and I should just be content with what I have. I know. But still, at $2,196—37% off—this is a screaming deal. Gorgeous, pure black OLED makes every image vivid and lush. And that’s all for now. I might add more items to this list as they turn up, but 10 is a great number for lists and guides and so for now at least, 10 is where we’ll end. Have a lovely Thanksgiving and may you play lots and lots of games! Follow me on Twitter . Check out my website . Erik Kain Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

A LinkedIn entry (shoutout to @bogorad222 for the discovery) from Mattel’s current VP of Global Marketing, PJ Lewis, highlights the figure, which he said is the largest digital-to-physical product line in Mattel’s history. Mattel released the first series of Minecraft mini-figures in 2014, the then-senior Director for Global Brand Marketing and Product Design said. Each mini figure is 1–1.5 inches tall and costs around $3–5, and there are about 20 series of them. Earlier this year, Mattel and Minecraft partnered again to create a new downloadable content (DLC) map called Camp Enderwood. The map features a variety of new characters and a brand-new, immersive gameplay experience. Camp Enderwood is available for free download on the Minecraft Marketplace. Jeff Y., Microsoft’s lead game developer, have also revealed on his LinkedIn page that the popular 3D sandbox adventure game generates over $100 million in annual revenue. The game reached its 100 million sales milestone in 2016, just two years after the Redmond-based tech giant acquired Mojang. This year, the number rose to 300 million copies worldwide.

                    "content": "IOST Coin is a cryptocurrency project focused on scalability and decentralization. The project aims to advance by offering fast, decentralized, and transparent blockchain infrastructure necessary for future online services. Its consensus algorithm uses the Proof-of-Believability method, focusing precisely on this aspect. The IOST team, realizing that multinational companies would never use blockchain-based technologies without sufficient scalability, has embarked on this path. Highlighting that the Proof-of-Work model used by Bitcoin is not scalable enough, the team is currently following its roadmap. What is IOST Coin? IOST Coin is the primary cryptocurrency of this blockchain network. The crypto, standing for Internet of Services, enables transactions on this highly scalable network. IOST targets corporate investors and has taken significant steps in this regard. Particularly, a collaboration with Microsoft Azure helped make IOST well-known. As of the writing of this article, IOST ranks as the 107th largest cryptocurrency. With a unit price of $0.0060, the IOST/USDT pair could significantly increase in value if it reaches more corporate users. Where to Buy IOST? How exactly is IOST Coin purchased? Binance emerges as the most popular platform for this purpose, offering liquidity and security that influence investor preferences. To buy IOST Coin, first deposit USD balance in the exchange or buy an alternative cryptocurrency. Start by visiting the Binance homepage, click on the “Buy Crypto ” option in the upper left, and then the “Credit/Bank Card” tab. In the opened tab, select how much USD you want to spend, and mark Tether, i.e., USDT in the Coin section. After purchasing USDT, preview the “Buy-Sell” option in the upper left again and click on the “Classic” tab. In the opened section, select the USDT tab from the upper right, type IOST in the search button, and select the IOST/USDT pair that appears below. Then go to the “BUY IOST” tab in the middle, enter the amount you want to buy. Enter the desired amount and complete the IOST Coin purchase by confirming the transaction.",

                    "content": "'s return as OpenAI's chief executive will strengthen his grip on the startup and may leave the creator with fewer checks on his power as the company introduces technology that could upend industries, corporate governance experts and analysts said. is bringing Altman back just days after his ouster as well as installing a revamped board that could bring sharper scrutiny to the startup at the heart of the AI boom, but strong support from investors including may give Altman more leeway to commercialize the technology. \"Sam's return may put an end to the turmoil on the surface, but there may continue to be deep governance issues,\" said Mak Yuen Teen, director of the centre for investor protection at the National University of Singapore Business School. \"Altman seems awfully powerful and it is unclear that any board would be able to oversee him. The danger is the board becomes a rubber stamp,\" he said. OpenAI's new board will boast more experience at the top level and strong ties to both the US government and Wall Street. The board fired Altman last week with little explanation and attempted to move on by naming an interim CEO twice. However, pressure from Microsoft — and the 38-year-old's strong loyalty among the 700-plus OpenAI employees that caused nearly all of them to threaten to leave the company — led to Altman's reinstatement as of Wednesday. \"Altman has been invigorated by the last few days,\" GlobalData analyst Beatriz Valle said. But that could come at a cost, she said, adding that he has \"too much power now.\" Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce who also played a key role in forcing through Elon Musk's $44 billion (nearly Rs. 3,66,530 crore) purchase of as a director, will be chairing the board. Other members include former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, a Harvard academic and longtime economic aide to Democratic presidents. \"The fact that Summers and Taylor will join OpenAI is quite extraordinary and marks a dramatic reversal of fortunes in the company,\" Valle said. Summers, who also sits on the board of Jack Dorsey's fintech firm Block, has in recent months been vocal about the potential job losses and disruption that could be caused by AI. \"ChatGPT is coming for the cognitive class. It's going to replace what doctors do,\" he said in a post on in April. OpenAI's previous board consisted of entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, as well as Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, who also sits on the new board. It was not immediately clear if any of the other directors would remain, including Sutskever, who joined in the effort to fire Altman then signed onto an employee letter demanding his return, expressing regret for her \"participation in the board's actions.\" OpenAI on X said it was \"collaborating to figure out the details\" of the new board. Microsoft declined to comment. Summers and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sutskever, Altman and Taylor could not be immediately reached for comment. Some analysts say the management fiasco will ensure that OpenAI executives proceed cautiously, as the high-flying startup will now be subject to more scrutiny. Several noted that companies such as Facebook parent Meta have flourished with a powerful CEO despite concerns about corporate governance. \"Sam definitely comes out stronger but also dirtied and will have more of a microscope from the AI and broader tech and business community,\" Gartner analyst Jason Wong said. \"He can no longer do no wrong.\" For the latest and , follow Gadgets 360 on , , , and .

                    "content": "Microsoft has acknowledged a known issue affecting Narrator in Windows 11, a screen reading tool that helps visually impaired users navigate the operating system. In an update on its Windows release health page, the Redmond-based tech giant says that the issue specifically arises when installing Windows 11, version 23H2 (also known as the Windows 11 2023 Update) using physical media or disc images (ISO). When using these installation methods, the Narrator may not start or may open in an unresponsive state, preventing visually impaired users from effectively proceeding with the installation process. This issue only appears when installing Windows 11 version 23H2 using physical media or ISOs, and not when installing it using Windows Update on a device that is already running Windows 10 or Windows 11. Microsoft says that while Narrator is present in Windows from the start of the installation process, it may not respond when initiated using any method, such as Ctrl + Windows key + Enter keyboard shortcuts. Microsoft is currently working on a resolution to this issue and expects to provide an update with updated media that can be used to install Windows 11, version 23H2 without encountering this problem. Elsewhere, Microsoft is also introducing AI tech to help visually impaired users, thanks to its partnership with Be My Eyes app. The app’s Be My AI feature employs OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 model to generate a textual description of a user-captured image into its Microsoft Disability Answer Desk, a service that handles customer support calls.",

How do we feel about there already being a \"Remaster\", and are its DVD extra-style additions worth a £10 upgrade? We also discuss some of the other remakes to arrive (again) this year, including the excellent new versions of Dead Space and Resident Evil 4. It's good these games are finding new audiences, but are we in danger of focusing too much on the past, and on safe, known franchises?

                    "content": "The fund have been spending N$7,3 million annually for student loans. This was revealed in a letter addressed to the parliamentary standing committee on public accounts, written by the fund. This letter, which details the amounts paid back since 2013, was confirmed by the acting chief executive officer (CEO) Kennedy Kandume yesterday. The highest amount recovered was N$15 million in the 2022/2023 financial year, while the NSFAF was owed N$6,9 billion. For this financial year, NSFAF has recovered N$9,2 million, while the loan book stands at N$7,9 billion. In the 2021/2022, they were paid back N$10,1 million while they were owed N$6,1 billion. In the 2020/2021 financial year, they got back N$4,3 million while their loan book stood at N$5,5 billion. The year before that, they recouped N$3,6 million while they were owed N$,9 billion. In 2018/19, N$3,2 million was received while their loan book stood at N$4,3 billion. In 2017/18, they were owed N$3,5 billion and only recouped N$4,1 million. In 2016/17, they got back N$4,5 million and were owed N$3,4 million. The previous year, N$4,6 million was reclaimed from the N$3,4 billion owed. In 2014/15, they were owed N$3,4 billion and recouped N$4,2 million. In the 2013/14 financial year, they recovered N$6,2 million while they were owed N$3,4 billion. The fund has spent N$7,3 million to recover the money owed to it. SPENT ON LOAN RECOVERY NSFAF paid N$200 008 to KPMG, an auditing firm, for Microsoft access, database design and data capture in a “pilot basis”. The Namibia Statistics Agency was paid N$2,6 million for data capturing and project management fees. The fund has a data integrity project which costs N$3,4 million. In 2020, the acting head explained that this project consolidates the database of past and current beneficiaries. To develop this project, the fund paid N$38 000 to Neishot Websolution Technologies. In 2020, employees demanded that the Central Procurement Board of Namibia investigate the contracting of Neishot Webolution Technologies at NSFAF. Tribesmen debt recovery firm was also paid N$1,2 million. This is another controversial contract which was cancelled. The N$400 million debt recovery contract was given to the Tribesmen and New Integrated Credit Solutions joint venture by NSFAF in 2014. In 2018, The Namibian reported that NSFAF was accused of hand-picking Tribesmen for the debt recovery contract, despite a public advertisement that was made in 2014, when 20 bids were submitted. Tribesmen has been getting a fixed N$287 500 plus 10% commission of the total money collected between February 2014 until this was increased to 12% commission in 2017. This means Tribesmen earned N$3,4 million on an annual basis. This brings the amount spent on the loan book to N$7,32 million. CHANGE REQUIREMENTS Meanwhile, Popular Democratic Movement lawmaker Inna Hengari has called for NSFAF to change the repayment period, in the face of the unemployed graduate statistics. “The biggest challenge with this policy is that the beneficiary is expected to commence paying back the fund within six months after graduation,” she said. Hengari on Tuesday was contributing to the debate on the possibility that NSFAF incentivises loan beneficiaries, with the aim to stimulate entrepreneurship and job creation. “I think, considering the environment and the economic climate in our country, it is almost impossible to find someone who comes directly from the university and gets a job within six months,” she said. Hengari further pointed out that NSFAF has the prerogative to suspend the repayment of a loan if the debtor becomes unemployed. “The different circumstances of each beneficiary should be considered when we look at this policy,” she added. Hengari shared her experience, saying she was on probation for six months and her income was not yet stable, while the interest holiday repayment loan waiver was not sufficient. In June 2022, NSFAF announced that it will be writing off N$2,6 billion interest on N$5,2 billion owed by beneficiaries from 1 July until 30 June 2023. “The situation we have in our country is that the day that you graduate, within six months, the interest already starts to accumulate on the loan that you have taken,” she said. Hengari blasted Kandume for the mismanagement of funds which he cannot account for. “The fund is mismanaged and failed to account for monies allocated to it… The very acting CEO of NSFAF has miserably failed to account for money that has gone missing year-in year-out. I am standing here as a member of the public accounts committee,” she said. Higher education minister Itah Kandjii-Murangi did not take kindly to Hengari’s statement, saying there has been notable transformation at NSFAF since the time Hengari was at the University of Namibia. “As we sit here, we are aware of the ongoing transformation. We are still fixated on the past… We have moved. NSFAF is being transformed,” she asserted. Kandjii-Murangi reiterated that the lost funds were due to files being moved from one office to the next. “To talk about the fact that the CEO failed to account. We all know and I stood here to say that what is not accounted for has to do with lost, misplaced records when the institution was moving from the ministry to become an independent,” she said.",

                    "content": "If you haven’t yet gotten a current-gen gaming console, now might be the time. Microsoft is currently offering an Xbox Series S ‘Starter Bundle’ for $299, down from its usual $380 price tag. The bundle includes the 512GB disc-less console and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (a $57 value). With Game Pass Ultimate, you can download or stream hundreds of games, including marquee exclusives like Starfield and Forza Motorsport . Interestingly, a 512GB Series S on its own is currently on sale for $319.99 ($60 off), so the Starter Bundle is cheaper while also including three months of Game Pass. You can buy the Series S Starter Bundle at the following Canadian retailers: The Series S is by far the most affordable way to get into the current gaming generation, since the Series S’ sister console, the Xbox Series X , is normally priced at $649 ($599 currently for Black Friday), and Sony’s rival PS5 costs $519 (Digital Edition) or $650 (standard model). Even the nearly seven-year-old Nintendo Switch, which is expected to be succeeded next year with new hardware , is $399. Of course, with the lower price comes reduced specs. While the Series S does sport the same speedy SSD as the Series X, the trade-off is up to 1440p resolution compared to the 4K-capable premium console. As mentioned, the Series S also doesn’t have a disc drive so you’ll only be able to play digital media. Otherwise, the Series S is a great value for the average consumer, especially with the Game Pass catalogue. In September, Microsoft launched a $449 1TB black Series S , so naturally, that new model isn’t on sale for Black Friday. That said, we did speak to one of the designers about it , and he unpacked the surprising amount of work that goes into designing new console colours. MobileSyrup utilizes affiliate partnerships.

                    "content": "AI | Nov 23, 2023 Altman’s abrupt dismissal , which led to a near-unanimous threat of resignation from OpenAI’s 750-strong workforce , was quickly followed by an “agreement in principle” for his return. This decision underscores the critical role Altman plays in the organization and the AI industry at large. The new board, chaired by Bret Taylor and including Larry Summers and Adam D’Angelo, reflects a strategic shift in OpenAI’s governance. This change suggests a more balanced approach, combining business acumen with technological insight . The board’s restructuring, with the departure of members like Helen Toner, Tasha McCauley, and co-founder Ilya Sutskever, indicates a move towards stabilizing the company’s governance and aligning it with its ambitious goals. The role of employees and investors in Altman’s return cannot be overstated. The overwhelming majority of OpenAI’s employees, including key figures like co-founder Ilya Sutskever, played a pivotal role in demanding the board’s resignation and Altman’s reinstatement . This collective action demonstrates the significant influence of internal stakeholders in corporate governance, especially in high-stakes industries like AI. Microsoft, as OpenAI’s biggest investor, was instrumental in the events leading to Altman’s return. CNBC’s report highlights Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s support for the new board and the continued partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI. This collaboration, including the formation of a new AI lab , signifies the deepening ties between the two entities and their shared vision for the future of AI. As Sam Altman reassumes his role as CEO of OpenAI, the path forward is both challenging and full of potential. Here’s what to look out for: Not your average tumultuous week in a startup. Sam Altman’s return to OpenAI, his leadership, along with the new board’s guidance, will be instrumental for the journey ahead for OpenAI and the AI community watching closely.

                    "content": "To manufacture semiconductor chips, big companies like Qualcomm, Nvidia, Apple, AMD, and MediaTek rely on TSMC’s fabrication technologies. Some companies also rely on to manufacture chips for mid-range models. It appears that some of them will not be moving from TSMC to Samsung Foundry’s 3nm process anytime soon, which is something the company was expecting would happen. Previously, some reports indicated that 3nm process could be used by Qualcomm to manufacture the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chips next year. In accordance with a new report shared by the China Times, TSMC’s 2nd-generation 3nm process (N3E) could be used by Qualcomm and MediaTek to fabricate the and the Dimensity 9400. Compared to the N3B (first-generation 3nm) technique that Apple is currently utilizing to create its A17 Pro processor for the iPhone 15 Pro series, this new technology will deliver gains in both performance and efficiency. In the past, a report indicated that the first-generation 3nm process by TSMC offered a 55% yield rate. Given this, the cost of manufacturing one wafer based on multiple chips was estimated to be around $20,000. Chip clients are charged regardless of the yield. Reportedly, 60,000 to 70,000 wafers are produced by TSMC per month using the 3nm process. It is expected to reach 100,000 wafers by 2024’s end. TSMC’s 3nm process currently generates 5% of its income, but next year that percentage is expected to increase to 10%. By 2030, hopes to use cutting-edge technologies to reverse its reputation and defeat TSMC. In contrast to FinFET, which TSMC utilizes in its 3nm process, it makes use of a novel transistor architecture known as GAA (Gate All Around), which is claimed to be more power efficient. However, the company has no big clients. A rumor previously suggested that the company could get orders from AMD and Qualcomm for its 3nm and 4nm processes. In addition to this, System LSI is working on the Exynos 2500 processor. Reportedly, it is more efficient than older versions of the Exynos chips. Some reports even point out that it will be Samsung’s Dream Chip. It is expected to launch next year.

                    "content": "The OpenAI power struggle that captivated the tech world after co-founder Sam Altman was fired has finally reached its end — at least for the time being. But what to make of it? It feels almost as though some eulogizing is called for — like OpenAI died and a new, but not necessarily improved, startup stands in its midst. Ex-Y Combinator president Altman is back at the helm, but is his return justified? OpenAI’s new board of directors is getting off to a less diverse start (i.e. it’s entirely white and male), and the company’s founding philanthropic aims are in jeopardy of being co-opted by more capitalist interests. That’s not to suggest that the old OpenAI was perfect by any stretch. As of Friday morning, OpenAI had a six-person board — Altman, OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI president Greg Brockman, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo and Helen Toner, director at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technologies. The board was technically tied to a nonprofit that had a majority stake in OpenAI’s for-profit side, with absolute decision-making power over the for-profit OpenAI’s activities, investments and overall direction. OpenAI’s unusual structure was established by the company’s co-founders , including Altman, with the best of intentions. The nonprofit’s exceptionally brief (500-word) charter outlines that the board make decisions ensuring “that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity,” leaving it to the board’s members to decide how best to interpret that. Neither “profit” nor “revenue” get a mention in this North Star document; Toner reportedly once told Altman’s executive team that triggering OpenAI’s collapse “would actually be consistent with the [nonprofit’s] mission.” Maybe the arrangement would have worked in some parallel universe; for years, it appeared to work well enough at OpenAI. But once investors and powerful partners got involved, things became… trickier. After the board abruptly canned Altman on Friday without notifying just about anyone, including the bulk of OpenAI’s 770-person workforce, the startup’s backers began voicing their discontent in both private and public. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major OpenAI collaborator , was allegedly “furious” to learn of Altman’s departure. Vinod Khosla, the founder of Khosla Ventures, another OpenAI backer, said on X (formerly Twitter) that the fund wanted Altman back. Meanwhile, Thrive Capital, the aforementioned Khosla Ventures, Tiger Global Management and Sequoia Capital were said to be contemplating legal action against the board if negotiations over the weekend to reinstate Altman didn’t go their way. Now, OpenAI employees weren’t unaligned with these investors from outside appearances. On the contrary, close to all of them — including Sutskever, in an apparent change of heart — signed a letter threatening the board with mass resignation if they opted not to reverse course. But one must consider that these OpenAI employees had a lot to lose should OpenAI crumble — job offers from Microsoft and Salesforce aside. OpenAI had been in discussions, led by Thrive, to possibly sell employee shares in a move that would have boosted the company’s valuation from $29 billion to somewhere between $80 billion and $90 billion. Altman’s sudden exit — and OpenAI’s rotating cast of questionable interim CEOs — gave Thrive cold feet, putting the sale in jeopardy. But now after several breathless, hair-pulling days, some form of resolution’s been reached. Altman — along with Brockman, who resigned on Friday in protest over the board’s decision — is back , albeit subject to a background investigation into the concerns that precipitated his removal. OpenAI has a new transitionary board , satisfying one of Altman’s demands. And OpenAI will reportedly retain its structure, with investors’ profits capped and the board free to make decisions that aren’t revenue-driven. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff posted on X that “the good guys” won. But that might be premature to say. Congrats to @openai ! Great to see the good guys win! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/7yitztXwuc — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) November 22, 2023 Sure, Altman “won,” besting a board that accused him of “not [being] consistently candid” with board members and, according to some reporting, putting growth over mission. In one example of this alleged rogueness, Altman was said to have been critical of Toner over a paper she co-authored that cast OpenAI’s approach to safety in a critical light — to the point where he attempted to push her off the board. In another, Altman “ infuriated ” Sutskever by rushing the launch of AI-powered features at OpenAI’s first developer conference. The board didn’t explain themselves even after repeated chances, citing possible legal challenges. And it’s safe to say that they dismissed Altman in an unnecessarily histrionic way. But it can’t be denied that the directors might have had valid reasons for letting Altman go, at least depending on how they interpreted their humanistic directive. The new board seems likely to interpret that directive differently. Currently, OpenAI’s board consists of former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, D’Angelo (the only holdover from the original board) and Larry Summers, the economist and former Harvard president. Taylor is an entrepreneur’s entrepreneur, having co-founded numerous companies, including FriendFeed (acquired by Facebook) and Quip (through whose acquisition he came to Salesforce). Meanwhile, Summers has deep business and government connections — an asset to OpenAI, the thinking around his selection probably went, at a time when regulatory scrutiny of AI is intensifying . The directors don’t seem like an outright “win” to this reporter, though — not if diverse viewpoints were the intention. While six seats have yet to be filled, the initial four set a rather homogenous tone; such a board would in fact be illegal in Europe, which mandates companies reserve at least 40% of their board seats for women candidates. I’m not the only one who’s disappointed. A number of AI academics turned to X to air their frustrations earlier today. Noah Giansiracusa, a math professor at Bentley University and the author of a book on social media recommendation algorithms, takes issue both with the board’s all-male makeup and the nomination of Summers, who he notes has a history of making unflattering remarks about women. “Whatever one makes of these incidents, the optics are not good, to say the least — particularly for a company that has been leading the way on AI development and reshaping the world we live in,” Giansiracusa said via text. “What I find particularly troubling is that OpenAI’s main aim is developing artificial general intelligence that ‘benefits all of humanity.’ Since half of humanity are women, the recent events don’t give me a ton of confidence about this. Toner most directly representatives the safety side of AI, and this has so often been the position women have been placed in, throughout history but especially in tech: protecting society from great harms while the men get the credit for innovating and ruling the world.” Christopher Manning, the director of Sanford’s AI Lab, is slightly more charitable than — but in agreement with — Giansiracusa in his assessment: “The newly formed OpenAI board is presumably still incomplete,” he told TechCrunch. “Nevertheless, the current board membership, lacking anyone with deep knowledge about responsible use of AI in human society and comprising only white males, is not a promising start for such an important and influential AI company.” I'm thrilled for OpenAI employees that Sam is back, but it feels very 2023 that our happy ending is three white men on a board charged with ensuring AI benefits all of humanity. Hoping there's more to come soon. — Ashley Mayer (@ashleymayer) November 22, 2023 Inequity plagues the AI industry, from the annotators who label the data used to train generative AI models to the harmful biases that often emerge in those trained models, including OpenAI’s models . Summers, to be fair, has expressed concern over AI’s possibly harmful ramifications — at least as they relate to livelihoods. But the critics I spoke with find it difficult to believe that a board like OpenAI’s present one will consistently prioritize these challenges, at least not in the way that a more diverse board would. It raises the question: Why didn’t OpenAI attempt to recruit a well-known AI ethicist like Timnit Gebru or Margaret Mitchell for the initial board? Were they “not available”? Did they decline? Or did OpenAI not make an effort in the first place? Perhaps we’ll never know. Reportedly , OpenAI considered Laurene Powell Jobs and Marissa Mayer for board roles, but they were deemed too close to Altman. Condoleezza Rice’s name was also floated, but ultimately passed over. OpenAI says the board will have women but they just can’t find them! It’s so hard because the natural makeup of a board is all white men, and it is especially important to include the men who had to step down from previous positions for their statements about women’s aptitude. https://t.co/QiiDd6Se18 — @timnitGebru@dair-community.social on Mastodon (@timnitGebru) November 23, 2023 OpenAI has a chance to prove itself wiser and worldlier in selecting the five remaining board seats — or three, should Altman and a Microsoft executive take one each (as has been rumored). If they don’t go a more diverse way, what Daniel Colson, the director of the think tank the AI Policy Institute, said on X may well be true: a few people or a single lab can’t be trusted with ensuring AI is developed responsibly.

                    "content": "Short-form videos are trending these days. These can be found across different platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Snack Video, YouTube, and others. A few years ago, Reels were introduced on Instagram. Some Reels grab the attention of users and they wish to download and save them for future purposes. Reels can be easily downloaded from Instagram accounts that are public, which is kind of concerning. Surprisingly, anyone can download from public accounts. It initially debuted in the US in June 2023 and now it is accessible to all users across the globe. The new feature was unveiled by Instagram’s CEO Adam Mosseri. Previously, third-party tools and web browser extensions were used to download Reels. As of now, the feature will be offered natively in the app. For individuals who download these short videos, data security would be strengthened, but for those who posted the Reel in the first place, privacy concerns would arise. One thing to notice here is that the new feature is enabled by default on all public accounts. It can be deactivated while uploading the Reels. First, record and edit your reel. Then, select Next from the menu on the lower right corner of the phone screen. Select More Choices from the bottom. Then, select Advanced Settings by swiping down. Choose the option to allow people to download your reels by scrolling down. Now, if you want to prevent others from downloading your Reels, disable the toggle. Select if you want to turn on or off the option to download reels for every video you post, or only the one you’re presently working on. Now press the Share button at the bottom after tapping the back button in the upper left corner. The feature is disabled by default for accounts that have an age cap (below 18 years). One thing to notice here is that the new feature is only available on new Reels. Your previous Reels won’t be downloadable from the Instagram app until you enable the option to make your entire profile public.

                    "content": "Key Findings Introduction Amid tensions in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Check Point Research has been conducting active threat hunting in an effort to discover, attribute, and mitigate relevant regional threats. Among those, some new variants of the SysJoker malware, including one coded in Rust, recently caught our attention. Our assessment is that these were used in targeted attacks by a Hamas-related threat actor. SysJoker, initially by Intezer in 2021, is a multi-platform backdoor with multiple variants for Windows, Linux and Mac. The same malware was also analyzed in another a few months after the original publication. Since then, SysJoker Windows variants have evolved enough to stay under the radar. As we investigated the newer variants of SysJoker that were utilized in targeted attacks in 2023, we also discovered a variant written in Rust, which suggests the malware code was completely rewritten. In addition, we also uncovered behavioral similarities with another campaign named which targeted Israel in 2016-2017. This campaign was previously linked to Gaza Cybergang (aka Molerats), a threat actor operating in conjunction with Palestinian interests. In this article, we drill down into the Rust version of SysJoker, as well as disclose additional information on other SysJoker Windows variants and their attribution. Rust SysJoker Variant The SysJoker variant ( ), written in Rust, was submitted to VirusTotal with the name on October 12, 2023. Compiled a few months earlier on August 7, it contains the following PDB path: . The malware employs random sleep intervals at various stages of its execution, which may serve as possible anti-sandbox or anti-analysis measures. The sample has two modes of operation which are determined by its presence in a particular path. This is intended to differentiate the first execution from any subsequent ones based on persistence. First, it checks whether the current running module matches the path . Based on the outcome the malware proceeds to one of the two possible stages. First execution If the sample runs from a different location, indicating it’s the first time the sample is executed, the malware copies itself to the path and then runs itself from the newly created path using PowerShell with the following parameter: Finally, it creates a persistence mechanism and then exits the program. Persistence is established in an unusual way, using PowerShell with the following argument: Eventually, this PowerShell code creates a registry key in the hive, which points to the copy of the executable, using the WMI class instead of directly accessing the registry via the Windows API or reg.exe. Subsequent executions (from persistence) SysJoker contacts a URL on OneDrive to retrieve the C2 server address. The URL is hardcoded and encrypted inside the binary: The response must should contain also a XOR-encrypted blob of data that is encoded in base64. During our investigation, the following response was received: After decryption, the C2 IP address and port are revealed: Using OneDrive allows the attackers to easily change the C2 address, which enables them to stay ahead of different reputation-based services. This behavior remains consistent across different versions of SysJoker. The malware collects information about the infected system, including the Windows version, username, MAC address, and various other data. This information is then sent to the API endpoint on the C2 server, and in response it receives a unique token that serves as an identifier when the malware communicates with the C2: After registration with the C2 server, the sample runs the main C2 loop. It sends a POST request containing the unique token to the endpoint, and the C2 responds with JSON data: The expected response from the server is a JSON that contains a field named that contains an array of actions for the sample to execute. Each array consists of and fields. The field is another JSON with fields called and . An example of the response from the server: The malware downloads a zip archive from the URL specified in the field. The archive contains an executable that after unzipping is saved as the field into folder. The archive is unzipped using the following PowerShell command: It is important to mention that in previous SysJoker operations, the malware also had the ability not only to download and execute remote files from an archive but also to execute commands dictated by the operators. This functionality is missing in the Rust version. After receiving and executing the file download command, depending on whether the operation was successful or not, the malware contacts the C2 server again and send a success or exception message to the path . The server sends back a JSON confirmation indicating that it has received the information: . Encryption The malware has two methods for string decryption. The first method is simple and appears across multiple SysJoker variants. The sample contains several base64-encoded encrypted data blobs and a base64-encoded key. Upon decryption, both blobs are base64-decoded and then XORed to produce the plain text strings. The second encryption method is tedious and is spliced in-line throughout the program repeatedly at compile time. This generates a complex string decryption algorithm throughout the sample. Windows SysJoker Variants In addition to the newly found Rust variant, we uncovered two more SysJoker samples that were not publicly exposed in the past. Both of these samples are slightly more complex than the Rust version or any of the previously analyzed samples, possibly due to the public discovery and analysis of the malware. One of these samples, in contrast to other versions, has a multi-stage execution flow, consisting of a downloader, an installer, and a separate payload DLL. DMADevice variant The DMADevice sample ( ) was compiled in May 2022, a few months after SysJoker was first uncovered. Like other versions, the malware starts by retrieving the C2 server address by contacting the URL: The OneDrive link responds with an encrypted base64-encoded string, which is decrypted with the XOR key . This is the same key that is used in the Rust version. The decrypted blob contains a JSON with the C2 domain in the following format: Next, the malware proceeds to the three-stage execution process. 1. The sample generates a unique bot ID, sends it in a POST request to the API endpoint, and receives back the JSON describing the desired malware setup on the infected machine. The JSON has the following structure: The field in the JSON is used to XOR-decrypt the other fields after they are base64-decoded: the field contains the victim’s IP address and the field contains the array with multiple values: Those values are utilized in the following order: The rest of the values are used in a few commands that establish persistence via the registry key and retrieve the current user name from into the temporary txt file. The config file, in our case , is stored on a disk encrypted (using the same key used to decrypt the domain) and base64-encoded. It contains encrypted JSON with the following fields: After performing all these operations, the sample executes its copy from and exits. 2. When the sample is executed again (via persistence from the previous stage), it checks the location it is running from. It then continues the execution by making a POST request to containing the uuid, user name, and user token, which is also generated by the malware: The server responds with a token generated on its side which is then used for all the subsequent C2 requests. 3. The token received during the previous stage is used for making POST requests to on the C2 server to retrieve the commands to execute. Similar to other SysJoker variants, the server responds with a JSON that contains field which is an array of actions to take. This version can download and execute files or run commands and upload the results to the C2 server. For each command in the array, the sample sends a response reporting if it was successful or not. AppMessagingRegistrar variant This variant has a compilation timestamp of June 2022 and has a quite different execution flow. The functionality of the malware is divided into two separate components: a downloader (DDN, ) and a backdoor (AppMessagingRegistrar, ). The threat actors first deliver a lightweight downloader. It creates the folder , then downloads a zip file from . It unzips the file, copies it into the file and then executes it. Splitting the functionality into separate components has proved effective: at the time of the first submission to VirusTotal (VT), the malware was not detected by any of the platform’s engines: Upon execution, this payload first checks the registry key for the UUID of the PC. If the registry key is not available, a UUID is generated using the function and is then saved to the previously mentioned key. The variant then proceeds to decrypt a hardcoded OneDrive URL to retrieve a C2 address. The XOR key in this sample is . After the C2 address is decrypted, a POST request is made to the C2 server API endpoint which contains the previously generated UUID. The server responds with a JSON containing a token and a status message: The status indicates if the request was valid or not, and the samples check specifically for the string . The is used for all the following C2 requests but unlike all the other samples, instead of using the body of requests, it is sent in the Authorization header: . This change could be to accommodate additional flows in the malware execution (discussed below) in which the malware sends a GET request instead of a POST and requires a mechanism for the server to identify the sender. The field is used as a global flag to indicate what actions the bot should take. There are four statuses available: If the received is 0, the malware creates the and folders. It then proceeds to: The exact purpose of those functions is unknown as we were not able to retrieve the DLL. However, due to the names and our analysis of previous versions of the malware, we believe they were part of the persistence and setup process. Finally, the malware sends an empty POST request to the API endpoint . The expected response from the server is an empty JSON. If the is 1, the malware continues to make requests to the C2 API endpoint in an infinite loop. To break the loop, the must change. If the is 3, the malware proceeds to download a DLL file from URL and saves it to the path . It then sends a request to the C2 API endpoint : if the server responds with a status the status flag is then set to 4. If the status is 4, the malware proceeds to make a GET request to the C2 API endpoint . The C2 server responds with a JSON with 3 parameters, , , and . The malware then loads the DLL and resolves the function . The and values sent from the server are used by as parameters. We were not able to retrieve the DLL, but based on the previous versions, this is likely a version of the main command running functionality for the backdoor, and its return value should be a string. After the function runs and returns a result, the received in the token is used in the POST request to the C2 which contains the output: Infrastructure The infrastructure used in this campaign is configured dynamically. First, the malware contacts a OneDrive address, and from there, it decrypts the JSON containing the C2 address with which to communicate. The C2 address is encrypted with a hardcoded XOR key and base64-encoded. This threat actor commonly uses cloud storage services. Previous reports show Google Drive was used for the same purpose. Ties to Operation Electric Powder The SysJoker backdoor uses its own custom encryption for three main strings: the OneDrive URL containing the final C2 address, the C2 address received from the request to OneDrive, and a PowerShell command used for persistence: This PowerShell command based on the StdRegProv WMI class is quite unique. It is shared between multiple variants of SysJoker and only appears to be shared with one other campaign, associated with Operation Electric Powder previously reported by ClearSky. The 2017 describes the persistent activity carried out in 2016-2017 against the Israel Electric Company (IEC). This operation used phishing and fake Facebook pages to deliver both Windows and Android malware. Windows malware used in this campaign consisted of a dropper, a main backdoor, and a Python-based keylogging and screen-grabbing module. Throughout our analysis of the operation, we saw indications suggesting that the same actor is responsible for both attacks, despite the large time gap between the operations. Both campaigns used API-themed URLs and implemented script commands in a similar fashion. This includes the registry value but is not the only common factor. For example, the following image shows the similarities between the commands used by different malware when gathering recon data from the infected device to temporary text files: Conclusion Although the SysJoker malware, which was first seen in 2021 and publicly described in 2022, wasn’t attributed to any known actor, we found evidence that this tool and its newer variants have been used as part of the Israeli-Hamas conflict. We were also able to make a connection between SysJoker and the 2016-2017 Electric Powder Operation against Israel Electric Company. In our report, we described the evolution of the malware and the changes in the complexity of its execution flow, as well as its latest shift to the Rust language and the latest infrastructure it uses. The earlier versions of the malware were coded in C++. Since there is no straightforward method to port that code to Rust, it suggests that the malware underwent a complete rewrite and may potentially serve as a foundation for future changes and improvements.

                    "content": "the billionaire talked about how AI and technology could change lives for good. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates believes that technology will not replace humans, but it could make a 3-day work week possible. The billionaire shared his views while talking to South African comedian and writer Trevor Noah on his podcast 'What Now'. The 68-year-old Microsoft cofounder said that AI will not be taking jobs but will \"change it forever.\" In the 45-minute-long conversation, the billionaire talked about how AI and technology could change lives for good. When Mr Noah asked about the threat of artificial intelligence to jobs, Mr Gates said there could one day be a time when humans \"don't have to work so hard.\" Mr Gates said, \"If you eventually get a society where you only have to work three days a week, that's probably OK.\" He even said there could exist a world where \"machines can make all the food and the stuff.\" The billionaire has highlighted both the risks and the benefits of AI in his previous interviews and blogs. In July, he addressed the risks of AI. \"I don't think AI's impact will be as dramatic as the Industrial Revolution, but it certainly will be as big as the introduction of the PC. Word processing applications didn't do away with office work, but they changed it forever,\" Mr Gates said at the time. \"Employers and employees had to adapt, and they did.\" He also pointed out the risks of AI, including \"misinformation and deepfakes, security threats, changes to the job market, and the impact on education.\" \"This is not the first time a new technology has caused a big shift in the labour market. I don't think AI's impact will be as dramatic as the Industrial Revolution, but it certainly will be as big as the introduction of the PC,\" he wrote. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com \"Another thing that's clear to me is that the future of AI is not as grim as some people think or as rosy as others think. The risks are real, but I am optimistic that they can be managed,\" he added.",

                    "content": "The big picture: Nvidia is accumulating a substantial amount of money, primarily due to its potent GPUs for AI acceleration. However, these computing devices are expensive and are facing growing challenges related to chip shortages. Sam Altman attempted to secure funding for a new AI chipmaker before OpenAI terminated his position due to perceived shortcomings in his \"candid\" communication with the board. OpenAI's management drama is becoming increasingly intriguing and tumultuous. The company recently terminated Sam Altman, who served as a board member before his appointment as CEO. However, Altman has now been reinstated , accompanied by a new board, and Greg Brockman has returned as OpenAI president. In the weeks leading up to his termination and subsequent reinstatement, Altman appeared to be actively seeking funds for a new venture centered around \"AI chip\" development. Insiders have disclosed that Altman aimed to raise billions of dollars from major global investors and even traveled to the Middle East to attract Saudi investment funds for his ambitious plan. The project, codenamed Tigris, intended to create new Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) specifically designed to efficiently handle substantial volumes of specialized AI workloads. Altman was reportedly proposing a cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's GPUs, which are widely recognized as the most sought-after computing units for accelerating AI algorithms. His plan sought to address the escalating costs associated with running platforms like ChatGPT and other OpenAI services, while also establishing a new supply line to mitigate challenges related to the GPU shortage. Seeking investment partners outside the US could, of course, become a cause for concern. As former US Treasury Department official Philip Ludvigson explains, \"if the foreign investments are passive – for example, don't come with board seats – and stay under 10%, they are less likely to face scrutiny.\" Altman would likely have no shortage of funding partners for his new venture now, as major existing investors in OpenAI, such as Microsoft, are ready to pour billions of dollars into whatever the entrepreneur is cooking. According to Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, the board's decision to fire Altman wasn't related to the AI chip venture or any other \"financial, business, safety, or security / privacy\" practice by the former/new CEO. The AI server market is expected to explode in just a few years, with Foxconn predicting a $150 billion business by 2027. Nvidia's revenues are currently skyrocketing, with the GPU company experiencing a net income increase of 1,259 percent compared to last year. In the short term, a low-cost TPU competitor would likely pose no threat to Jensen Huang's company.

                    "content": "This is the week when I typically write a column about how to shop for holiday gifts. I wrote previous holiday gift columns based on my personal experiences and a bit of online searching. This year, I’m getting a little help from ChatGPT, which is able to recommend gifts, create holiday cards and help you decide what products to buy. Related Articles My first use of ChatGPT to recommend a purchase was a Thanksgiving present for myself and my wife. Many years ago, we had a George Foreman grill. I wanted to see what was new in that type of appliance, so I asked ChatGPT to recommend indoor grills. It came up with a relatively long list, so I asked for a grill with a timer, which shortened the list. I kept asking for features I wanted until it narrowed it down to just a couple of options. Then I asked both ChatGPT and Google Bard to give me professional reviews of my two top options and wound up with brief quotes from articles from sites like TechRadar, CNET, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports and The Spruce Eats. I specified “professional” to avoid the many dishonest reviews that flood the internet. I picked one and then asked for help in buying it, I got a list of online retailers that carried it. I also asked for the retailer with the cheapest price. It gave me the lowest price it could find, along with a link to buy it. My indoor grill arrived two days later, and it was great, except for one thing. I asked ChatGPT to recommend one with a timer and naively assumed that a timer on a grill would also turn it off when the time was up. It turned out that the timer just displayed elapsed time or time left and beeped when it was time to check the food, but it didn’t turn off the power, which, for me, is important because I worry about forgetting. I temporarily installed a workaround: a Wi-Fi smart plug that I can control with Amazon Alexa by saying “Alexa, turn off the grill in 20 minutes.” Knowing that I can return the product, I went back to ChatGPT and asked for one with auto-shutoff. It recommended some, including one that I ordered. I haven’t received it yet, so it remains to be seen whether I’ll like it. This was a good lesson for me. The key to using generative AI is knowing how to ask the question. If you want specific information, you have to ask specific questions. ChatGPT, Bard and other generative AI products have an enormous amount of information, but they can’t (yet) read minds, and they don’t necessarily anticipate questions that you don’t ask. Knowing how to write a good prompt may turn out to be a marketable skill. I also used ChatGPT, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing to help a friend of mine pick out a Christmas present for her husband by typing “help me find a gift for my 55-year-old husband who lives in Colorado and likes to hike and golf.” ChatGPT came up with some pretty creative ideas – gifts that I would never think of – including the book “Fifty Places to Play Golf Before You Die” and FootJoy WeatherSof Golf Glove. Google Bard came up with a golf GPS watch and a hiking hammock among other suggestions. Many years ago, I wrote a column about printing holiday cards at home. It’s pretty easy to do, especially if you have Microsoft Word or another program that has templates designed for greeting cards. But the key to a good greeting card is artwork and what is written, so I turned to the paid version of ChatGPT ($20 a month) for help with both the art and the text. The results were great. For families I know that celebrate both holidays, I asked it to “draw a combination Christmas and Hanukkah card and got a beautiful piece of unique art. At my wife’s suggestion, I then asked it to add peace symbols and got another beautiful and unique drawing. Finally, I asked for some text for the card, which included the following: ‘As the candles of Hanukkah brighten the winter nights, and the lights of Christmas sparkle with joy and delight, may this season bring you warmth, happiness, and peace. A time of love and laughter, of memories that never cease.” Neither I nor Hallmark could say it any better. ChatGPT gets the last word. Related Articles",

So you can save big on plenty of great products right now during these Black Friday deals. Including some massive discounts on new OLED and QLED TVs right now. I’ve been covering Black Friday for over 11 years here at AndroidHeadlines , and I’m here to help you find the best deals, and save some cash this holiday season. So far, we have seen the biggest discounts on laptops and TVs, this is pretty common as they are generally big ticket items, and items that everyone is going to buy. I’ll be posting the best deals available here, and some of these I’ve even bought myself. Like the Google Pixel 8 Pro, which is currently $200 off. That’s a really great deal, especially since you are not being asked to trade anything in. I’ve also bought plenty of holiday gifts already, it’s never too early to get a head start on your Christmas Shopping, and now is the kickoff to the holiday season. You’ll want to bookmark this page, so you can get all the latest updates during Black Friday, which officially starts on November 24, 2023. Black Friday Deals Best Black Friday Deals These are the best Black Friday Deals that you can grab right now. Many of these are at all-time lows, and they will not last very long. This is the latest and greatest from Google, with plenty of AI, camera smarts and the latest version of Android. Pixel 8 Pro comes with a stunning 6.7-inch QHD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate and it gets insanely bright at up to 2,400 nits. When we reviewed the Pixel 8 Pro last month, we called it the “Smartest Android Phone”, and that’s because of the very many features powered by Artificial Intelligence. That includes the ability to use Google Assistant to summarize webpages, using generative AI for photos and so much more. Of course, we cannot forget that the Pixel 8 Pro does come with seven years of updates from Google. That means that it is going to get updated to Android 21, which is mindblowing. Google Pixel 8 Pro - Best Buy If you’re on the fence about buying an air fryer, let me tell you, buy it. It’s perhaps the best decision I’ve ever made, and I really wish I had this air fryer. The Instant Vortex Plus XL is a really good option, not only because it’s larger, but it has two drawers that can cook food at two different temperatures. This is great for cooking meat and vegetables, which need to be cooked at different temperatures, at the same time. Of course ,an air fryer is definitely healthier, since you are frying with air and not oil. That eliminates the majority of the fat that you’d find with fried food. Instant Vortex Plus XL - Amazon The Fitbit Charge 6 is the latest fitness tracker from the company – now owned by Google. It offers all of the usual fitness features that you’d expect to see in a Fitbit. And that includes a seven-day battery life, which is what really sets this apart from other smartwatches and fitness trackers on the market today. Fitbit Charge 6 - Best Buy This TV isn’t super special, it’s not QLED or OLED, instead it’s an LED panel which still looks really good. The point of this TV is to get a huge TV at a low price. This is a massive 75-inch TV that you can get for under $600 which is really incredible. Samsung 75-inch TU690T 4K TV - Best Buy Samsung’s Galaxy S23 Ultra is the phone of the year, by most accounts, and right now you can pick it up for just $899. That’s $300 off of its regular price, and that does bring it down to an all-time low price. The Galaxy S23 Ultra has a lot going for it, including some really impressive battery life, a stunning 6.8-inch QHD+ display, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy inside powering the phone. Samsung also includes a stunning set of cameras here. With a 200-megapixel main camera that will take some amazing photos, along with two telephoto cameras that are 3x and 10x. Giving you up to 100x digital zoom. We can’t forget about the ultrawide camera that is also capable of macro shots. And now you can pick it up for under $900. Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra - Best Buy The Roborock S8 Pro Ultra is by far my favorite robot vacuum of 2023. And right now for Black Friday it is down to its all-time lowest price. So there’s never been a better time to pick one up. This robot vacuum is pricey, but it does just about everything for you. This includes having a way to empty the dustbin every time it docks. As well as cleaning the mopping pad, and refilling the water reservoir. In fact, Roborock’s vacuums can also use actual soap. So it’s really cleaning your floors instead of using cold water to clean them. Like I said, this one is pricey, but definitely worth the price. Roborock S8 Pro Ultra - Amazon Black Friday Deals under $25 These are all really great stocking stuffers, and gifts for your coworkers, or extended family. Those that you don’t want to spend an arm and a leg on, but still get them a really nice gift. Streaming Deals Black Friday is really the only time of the year that we see some really great streaming deals on a slew of streaming services. This includes Hulu, Paramount, Max, Peacock and more. Computer component Deals If you’re looking to build a computer, or maybe replace some parts in your current desktop gaming machine, Black Friday is definitely the time to buy some parts. Many of which are at all-time lows right now. Phones & Tablets Deals For Black Friday this year, there are a ton of really great phone and tablet deals available, our favorites include the Galaxy S23 Ultra which is now at an all-time low. And for tablets, the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus is an incredible offer especially with that OLED display in tow. TV and Soundbar Deals Get a new TV in time for College Football’s Bowl season. Who doesn’t want to watch Georgia win their third-straight National Title on an upgraded TV? Gaming Deals You’re going to be spending a lot of time with your family over the next month, and not all of us really want to talk to them. So for Black Friday, you can pick up some new games and consoles at decent prices. Laptop Deals Save big on some of the best laptops that were released in 2023, and even a few older ones. Robot Vacuum Deals Put that vacuum down and let the robot do it for you. They are supposed to be taking over the world anyways. Smartwatch & Wearables Deals Whether you want to tell time, get notifications on your wrist or improve your health, a smartwatch or wearable is a really good gift, not at cheaper prices. Apple Device Deals Get something good for your Apple-loving family and friends this holiday season, now at Black Friday prices. When is Black Friday? Black Friday officially starts on November 24, 2023. But as we all know, Retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and many more, opt to start their Black Friday deals well before that date. In fact, Amazon started its Black Friday sale in earnest on November 17, 2023. When is Cyber Monday 2023? Cyber Monday is always the Monday after Black Friday, and this year, that happens to fall on November 27, 2023. Cyber Monday often times appears to be an after-thought, since Black Friday was just a couple of days before Cyber Monday. How did AndroidHeadlines choose these deals? These deals had to fit one of two questions we ask ourselves. That is, is this a deal that we want to buy ourselves? The second is, is this an all-time low price, or something that rarely goes on sale? If the answer is yes to either of those questions, then we list it as a deal. Just like all of you out there, we here at AndroidHeadlines like to save some cash on everyday items, and some items to splurge on, like a new robot vacuum.",

                    "content": "As we end the year and look ahead to 2024, it’s instructive to consider which growth stocks are likely to outperform moving forward . Third-quarter earnings season provided some clues as several technology companies issued impressive results and gave bullish outlooks for the coming year. Many of these tech names are not the usual suspects. While the mega-cap tech stocks continue to lead the market higher, many smaller technology concerns are also posting impressive gains and should continue to outperform as we enter a New Year. Investors will want to take positions in these securities now so as not to miss any further gains. Here are seven steady growth stocks to buy before 2024. Arm Holdings (ARM) The initial public offering this September wasn’t great. And its stock is down 5% since its market debut. But long-term investors should consider the growth potential of British chipmaker Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM ). After all, this is a company whose microchips and semiconductors can be found in nearly every smartphone on the planet, as well as in a host of other electronic devices. And Arm’s first publicly released financial results were encouraging. Arm Holdings just issued its first earnings report as a publicly traded company, and the results exceeded expectations. For the third quarter that ended Sept. 30, Arm reported earnings per share of 36 cents, which matched analyst forecasts. Revenue amounted to $806 million versus $744.3 million that was expected. The company’s revenue grew 28% from a year earlier. Impressively, Arm reported it sold more than 7.1 billion microchips in the three months between July and September. It’s still early, however Arm Holdings has potential and should be a long-term growth story for many years to come. Zoom Video Communications (ZM) Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM ) is another growth stock that deserves some consideration. Granted, the stock is a long way from its pandemic peak when the move to online work and school propelled it up nearly 400%. Essentially, Zoom Video’s stock has done a round trip; today it trades near the $62 price it closed at on its first day of trading back in 2019. However, the company has weathered the post-Covid-19 reopening and its financials show steady improvement . Zoom Video just reported Q3 EPS of $1.29, which was ahead of consensus forecasts for $1.08. Revenue in the quarter came in at $1.137 billion, up 3.2% from a year ago and better than analyst expectations of $1.119 billion. Zoom said that its customers contributing more than $100,000 in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis was up 13.5% from a year earlier. Looking forward, Zoom forecasts revenue of $1.125 billion to $1.13 billion, and profits of $1.13 to $1.15 a share. The outlook was ahead of consensus views. The company finished the quarter with $6.5 billion of cash on hand. ZM stock is down 2% on the year. Datadog (DDOG) Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG ) is a rip-roaring growth stock. The software company’s stock rose nearly 30% in a single trading session after its Q3 print, bringing its year-to-date gain to 54%. Since the company went public in 2019, its share price has gained 207%. It helps that Datadog’s software is used in the red hot area of cloud-computing. Specifically, Datadog’s cloud monitoring and security products integrate with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), among others. Strong demand for its cloud security software led Datadog to report Q3 EPS of 45 cents, beating expectations for 34 cents. Revenue during Q3 came in at $547.5 million, up 25% from a year earlier and beating Wall Street forecasts that called for revenue of $524.1 million. The company also lifted its full-year guidance , saying it now expects Q4 revenue of $564 million to $568 million, and full-year revenue of $2.1 billion. Both figures exceeded Wall Street’s consensus forecasts. Palantir (PLTR) It hasn’t gotten a lot of attention, but shares of data analytics firm Palantir (NYSE: PLTR ) are more than 200% this year, making it one of the best-performing tech stocks. The company’s share price is now 116% higher than its 2020 market debut. The company and its stock endured a difficult downturn during the 2022 bear market and subsequent “tech wreck.” But they have bounced back this year thanks to strong quarterly results and less of a reliance on government contracts than in the past. Recently, PLTR stock jumped 16% higher after the company reported Q3 earnings that beat Wall Street forecasts and raised its full-year revenue guidance. Palantir reported EPS of 7 cents compared to 6 cents that was expected by analysts. Revenue came in at $558 million versus $556 million anticipated. The company’s sales rose 17% from a year earlier. Equally impressive was news that Palantir’s commercial (non-government) revenue grew 33% year-over-year. The company raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $2.216 billion and $2.22 billion, up from previous guidance of $2.212 billion for all of this year. Netflix (NFLX) Winners and losers are starting to emerge in the streaming industry, and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is clearly in the winners camp. The company is one of only two streaming services that is currently making a profit. The other being Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD ). Netflix is achieving sustained success not only from a strong line-up of content, but also by adapting to market realities that led it to crackdown on password sharing and place advertisements on its platform for the first time. The steps taken to adapt its business model are paying off judging by the company’s latest financial results. For Q3, Netflix reported EPS of $3.73, which was better than the $3.49 expected. Revenue totaled $8.54 billion, matching forecasts. Of course the most important number was paid subscriptions, which rose by 8.8 million net new additions in Q3 compared to Wall Street estimates of 6.1 million. Netflix said the positive quarter was due to increased subscription fees and improving profitability. Netflix said it now expects a profit margin of 20% for this year, and 22% to 23% in 2024. The company also continues to raise its prices without losing subscribers. NFLX stock is up 61% this year. SoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI ) is another growth stock that is still recovering from the 2022 downturn. So far this year, SOFI stock has increased 46% , including a 5% uptick after the financial technology company reported better-than-expected Q3 numbers and raised its guidance. SoFi had also suffered from the federal government’s moratorium on student loan repayments during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, that area of its business is now on the mend too. Owing to growth in its student loan segment , SoFi reported a Q3 loss of 3 cents a share, which was less than the loss of 8 cents expected on Wall Street. Revenue in Q3 totaled $530.72 million, which was ahead of the $511 million that was forecast by analysts. Student loan originations amounted to $919.3 million, which was well above a forecast of $651.5 million. Personal and home loans made by SoFi also beat expectations, and the company raised its forward guidance for all of this year, impressing investors. Meta Platforms (META) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) is firing on all cylinders , and this fact is reflected in its share price, which has risen 172%. The company has bounced back big time from a steep decline in 2022 and questions about its strategy that focused on building the theoretical world known as the “metaverse.” Now focused on AI, Meta has released a slate of new products and strong earnings that have analysts and investors feeling bullish about the company and its stock once again. In September, Meta unveiled the Quest 3 virtual reality headset, which will retail for $499. The company also unveiled generative AI chatbots and announced a new version of its Ray-Ban mixed reality smart glasses that can capture photographs and videos with a voice command. The new products impressed consumers and Wall Street traders, as did the company’s Q3 numbers. The company reported a 23% increase in its Q3 revenue , the fastest growth rate in two years, as the market for online ads rebounds.

                    "content": "Microsoft will reportedly discontinue the Microsoft Rewards app on Xbox, a controversial move that practically ends its handsome incentives like weekly challenges and streaks. The move comes as the company transitions to a new Rewards hub on Xbox, which will provide a more streamlined and integrated rewards experience for players. Several gamers have spotted a warning message on their consoles. The weekly series of activities in the Microsoft Rewards app on Xbox will continue until the end of November, after which the app will be deactivated. Players will still be able to earn and redeem Rewards points through the new Rewards hub on Xbox. Its five-year run is finally coming to an end. Take a look at the full screenshot below, courtesy of @IdleSloth84_ and @GustavoOsrio1 : É por causa disso pic.twitter.com/16yPrKHjxr — Gustavo Osório (@GustavoOsrio1) November 22, 2023 The original message is in Portuguese, but it’s been translated using Google Translate for clarity. The full message reads: Earn Rewards with Xbox We recreate activities, which we simplify and more integrate players love. The Rewards experience on Xbox by making it revolve around gameplay and with the new Rewards hub on Xbox, players will no longer need to have separate apps to earn or redeem Reward points on Xbox Starting in December 2023, we will no longer publish offers in the Microsoft Rewards app on Xbox, focusing instead on new one Rewards. Basically, this change is intended to simplify and streamline the Rewards experience for activities in the new hub players and help them access all Xbox-related offers and activities in one convenient location. The weekly series continues until the end of November and, after that, it will be deactivated in the application, along with the weekly sequence, Rewards with Xbox will remain part of the Microsoft Rewards program, and any points you earn on Xbox will continue being associated with points from other parts of the program.

                    "content": "AI is proliferating in each and every sector of the tech industry at a rapid pace. All three big tech giants—Apple, Google, and Samsung—are working to introduce AI features to their services, products, and devices. Meta, the owner of social media platforms Facebook, , and Instagram, is not behind this race. One such feature is Meta AI, an AI-powered assistant that users can communicate with and ask questions of on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. The AI features will be rolled out in gradual phases. Just recently, the company debuted the AI assistant on the Android version of the beta app. It is now ready to be rolled out to iOS version 23.24.10.71 of the app. It accompanies a shortcut to the assistant in the Chats tab. Similar to other virtual assistants, Meta AI will enable real-time conversations. It can give answers to your questions in real-time using Microsoft’s Bing search engine and make automatic recommendations for topics you could be discussing in a chat. One such example is in a group chat where the assistant can help members by suggesting a restaurant or picnic spot. The company is working on several AI characters. These characters will be accompanied by different backgrounds, opinions, personalities, and interests. Notably, the characters will be available on other Meta platforms as well. Currently, the Meta AI is only accessible in the US. There are no details on when it will be introduced in other regions. Furthermore, the new feature is not accessible to all users rather it is limited to a few beta testers of the app. Perhaps there will be a wider rollout in the near future but exactly when there is no information about it.

                    "content": "OpenAI and Sam Altman have been in the news for the last week for different reasons, including the and the much-anticipated . However, a new story unfolded today after Reuters reported a letter written by researchers at OpenAI warning about an all-new AI discovery, Project Q* (or called Q Star). The latest Reuters report highlights this AI breakthrough, which has been unreported so far. This all-new revelation opens up the debate about Altman's intentions, too. It adds that the letter could be one of the factors leading to Altman's firing. Based on the limited information on Project Q* shared in the , it looks like Altman got a breakthrough in the company's long search for artificial general intelligence (long for AGI). Altman's blog earlier this year described AGI as \"AI systems that are generally smarter than humans.\" He also talked about how if AGI was created successfully, it could help elevate humanity by pushing the global economy. However, Altman did mention the cons of this superintelligence, \"AGI would also come with serious risk of misuse, drastic accidents, and societal disruption.\" \"Because the upside of AGI is so great, we do not believe it is possible or desirable for society to stop its development forever; instead, society and the developers of AGI have to figure out how to get it right,\" from February 2023. As per the Reuters report, Project Q* could threaten humanity, which reminds us of the Terminator movies. It further adds that the new model on which Altman was working solved math problems, which is where it gets interesting. Generative AI relies on mathematical models and broadly is a subset of machine learning. For AI to solve a math problem is algorithmic as it follows a resolution path. To put some context, currently, generative AI is mainly used in writing be it typing emails for a particular need or how Gmail utilises for predicting your next word. The letter sent to the OpenAI board before Altman was fired flagged the new AI's capabilities and stressed safety concerns, which seemed to be being given low priority. OpenAI acknowledged its employees about Project Q* after the Reuters report. However, the exact details of what this breakthrough in AI meant weren't disclosed. Recapping the week's episode at OpenAI, it for Sam Altman to be fired as the CEO and then reinstated. In solidarity with the narrative of , several OpenAI after Altman's sudden firing. Apart from staff, Altman also got immense support from other senior executives like Greg Brockman, then President and co-founder at OpenAI. However, after negotiations with the new board, Altman re-joined as the CEO. Between getting fired and being reinstated, Altman also got the opportunity to join Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team. For the latest and , follow Gadgets 360 on , , , and .

                    "content": "NEW YORK — It’s been quite a week for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI — and co-founder Sam Altman. Altman, who helped start OpenAI as a nonprofit research lab back in 2015, was removed as CEO Friday in a sudden and mostly unexplained exit that stunned the industry. And while his chief executive title was swiftly reinstated just days later, a lot of questions are still up in the air. Advertisement If you’re just catching up on the OpenAI saga and what’s at stake for the artificial intelligence space as a whole, you’ve come to the right place. Here’s a rundown of what you need to know. Who is Sam Altman and how did he rise to fame? Altman is co-founder of OpenAI, the San Francisco-based company behind ChatGPT (yes, the chatbot that’s seemingly everywhere today — from schools to health care ). Advertisement The explosion of ChatGPT since its arrival one year ago propelled Altman into the spotlight of the rapid commercialization of generative AI — which can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. And as he became Silicon Valley’s most sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of this technology, Altman helped transform OpenAI into a world-renowned startup. But his position at OpenAI hit some rocky turns in a whirlwind that was the past week. Altman was fired as CEO Friday — and days later, he was back on the job with a new board of directors. Within that time, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and has rights to its existing technology, helped drive Altman’s return, quickly hiring him as well as another OpenAI co-founder and former president, Greg Brockman, who quit in protest after the CEO’s ousting. Meanwhile, hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to resign. Both Altman and Brockman celebrated their returns to the company in posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, early Wednesday. Why does removal — and reinstatement — matter? There’s a lot that remains unknown about Altman’s initial ousting. Friday’s announcement said he was “not consistently candid in his communications” with the then-board of directors, which refused to provide more specific details. Regardless, the news sent shockwaves throughout the AI world — and, because OpenAI and Altman are such leading players in this space, may raise trust concerns around a burgeoning technology that many people still have questions about. “The OpenAI episode shows how fragile the AI ecosystem is right now, including addressing AI’s risks,” said Johann Laux, an expert at the Oxford Internet Institute focusing on human oversight of artificial intelligence. The turmoil also accentuated the differences between Altman and members of the company’s previous board, who have expressed various views on the safety risks posed by AI as the technology advances. Advertisement Multiple experts add that this drama highlights how it should be governments — and not big tech companies — that should be calling the shots on AI regulation, particularly for fast-evolving technologies like generative AI. “The events of the last few days have not only jeopardized OpenAI’s attempt to introduce more ethical corporate governance in the management of their company, but it also shows that corporate governance alone, even when well-intended, can easily end up cannibalized by other corporate’s dynamics and interests,” said Enza Iannopollo, principal analyst at Forrester. The lesson, Iannopollo said, is that companies can’t alone deliver the level of safety and trust in AI that society needs. “Rules and guardrails, designed with companies and enforced by regulators with rigor, are crucial if we are to benefit from AI,” he added. What is generative AI? How is it being regulated? Unlike traditional AI, which processes data and completes tasks using predetermined rules, generative AI (including chatbots like ChatGPT) can create something new. Tech companies are still leading the show when it comes to governing AI and its risks, while governments around the world work to catch up. In the European Union, negotiators are putting the final touches on what’s expected to be the world’s first comprehensive AI regulations. But they’ve reportedly been bogged down over whether and how to include the most contentious and revolutionary AI products, the commercialized large-language models that underpin generative AI systems including ChatGPT. Advertisement Chatbots were barely mentioned when Brussels first laid out its initial draft legislation in 2021, which focused on AI with specific uses. But officials have been racing to figure out how to incorporate these systems, also known as foundation models, into the final version. Meanwhile, in the U.S., President Joe Biden signed an ambitious executive order last month seeking to balance the needs of cutting-edge technology companies with national security and consumer rights. The order — which will likely need to be augmented by congressional action — is an initial step that is meant to ensure that AI is trustworthy and helpful, rather than deceptive and destructive. It seeks to steer how AI is developed so that companies can profit without putting public safety in jeopardy.",
